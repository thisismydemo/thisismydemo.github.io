## Azure Local: New Hardware and Validated Nodes

Azure Local (formerly Azure Stack HCI) is Microsoft's premier hybrid cloud-integrated HCI platform â€“ but it comes with strict hardware prescriptions and significant cost implications. If you're considering this route as your VMware replacement, here are the key hardware considerations:

### Azure Local Pricing: What It Really Costs

Azure Local operates on a **dual subscription model** that organizations must understand before committing:

> **ðŸ’° Azure Local Total Cost Breakdown**
>
> - **Azure Local Service**: $10/core/month (mandatory for all physical cores)
> - **Windows Server Licensing**: $23.30/core/month (unless using existing licenses with Software Assurance)
> - **Hardware Investment**: New validated nodes required in most cases

**Real-World Cost Example**: A typical 4-node cluster with dual 16-core processors (128 total cores):
- Azure Local service: $1,280/month
- Windows Server licensing: $2,982/month (if new licenses needed)
- **Total monthly cost**: $4,262 before hardware amortization

Compare this to Windows Server perpetual licensing, where you pay once and own the license indefinitely (with optional Software Assurance for updates).

### Current Azure Local Catalog: Vendor Solutions

The Azure Local catalog has expanded significantly in 2024-2025:

| **Vendor** | **Solution Lines** | **Deployment Types** | **Key Advantages** |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Dell** | PowerEdge (AX, VX series) | 2-16 nodes, ROBO to datacenter | Integrated APEX support, lifecycle management |
| **HPE** | ProLiant DL145 Gen11, Apollo | Edge-optimized, full rack solutions | HPE GreenLake integration, hybrid management |
| **Lenovo** | ThinkAgile MX1020/MX1021 | 2-node edge, branch office focus | Pre-configured appliances, simplified deployment |
| **DataON** | AZS series | Storage-optimized configurations | High-density storage, cost-effective options |

**Key Reality Check**: While the catalog offers variety, **delivery timelines** for validated nodes can be 8-16 weeks, potentially impacting your VMware exit timeline.

### Hardware and Infrastructure Requirements

* **Validated Hardware Only:** Azure Local is **sold as a solution**, not just software. Microsoft works with hardware partners to provide a catalog of validated node configurations and integrated systems. In fact, you cannot simply install Azure Local on any random server and call it a supported production deployment â€“ it needs to align with a supported combination of components (CPU, drives, NICs, firmware, etc.). As noted earlier, existing servers can only be used if they **exactly match a current validated node profile** in the Azure Local Catalog. For the vast majority of environments, this means **buying new nodes** that are listed in the Azure Local Catalog. These are often sold in pre-configured clusters of 2, 4, or more nodes, with all identical hardware. This ensures that the cluster will pass Microsoft's HCI validation and that you have a single throat to choke for support (often the OEM will handle first-line support for the hardware, with Microsoft covering the software). The emphasis on validated hardware is to ensure reliability â€“ Microsoft and OEMs run extensive stress tests on these configurations. Deploying on something off-list risks hitting firmware or driver issues under load, which is why *"following the validated hardware path"* is strongly urged. In the HCI world, an misbehaving component can bring big headaches, so Microsoft's stance (echoed by partners like Dell) is to stick to known-good builds to **avoid playing whack-a-mole with obscure hardware issues**.

**Current Azure Local Catalog State:** As of late 2024, the catalog includes:

- **100+ validated hardware configurations** from leading vendors
- **New low-specification options** for smaller deployments
- **Expanded processor support** including Intel and AMD latest generations
- **Flexible storage configurations** accommodating various workload types

However, the catalog's expansion doesn't change the fundamental reality: existing enterprise hardware rarely meets the precise specifications required for certification. The result is a rock-solid platform, but at the cost of being locked into new hardware purchases in the near term.

> **ðŸš« Critical Limitation: No External SAN Support**
>
> Azure Local **cannot integrate with existing SAN infrastructure**. Unlike Windows Server Failover Clustering, which supports both SAN and hyper-converged storage, Azure Local is **Storage Spaces Direct only**.
>
> **Impact**: If you have a recently purchased SAN with years of useful life remaining, Azure Local provides no migration path to preserve that investment. Your storage investment becomes a sunk cost.

* **Hyper-Converged Storage (No SAN):** Azure Local's architecture is inherently hyper-converged â€“ it **requires Storage Spaces Direct** using local disks in each node. Unlike a Windows Server cluster, **you cannot use an external SAN** with Azure Local for your VM storage. The system will not even allow adding a shared LUN to the cluster; all storage must be direct-attached to the hosts (or in a single-node scenario, attached JBOD, but not shared between nodes). This means that if you have an existing SAN, Azure Local provides no way to incorporate it â€“ that storage would become effectively sidelined (perhaps used for backups or secondary storage, but not for the HCI cluster's primary workloads). Azure Local's philosophy is to instead use internal NVMe, SSD, and possibly HDDs to create a software-defined pool. This delivers excellent performance (especially with all-flash NVMe configurations) and simplifies management to one layer. But it reinforces that moving to Azure Local is a **full infrastructure replacement**: new servers *with their own internal storage* handle everything. It's an all-in-one approach.

### Network Infrastructure: Beyond Basic Connectivity

Azure Local's hyper-converged architecture places significant demands on your network infrastructure:

#### Mandatory Network Standards Compliance
- **IEEE 802.1Q**: VLAN support (required in all scenarios)
- **IEEE 802.1Qbb**: Priority Flow Control for lossless storage traffic
- **IEEE 802.1Qaz**: Enhanced Transmission Selection for QoS
- **IEEE 802.1AB**: Link Layer Discovery Protocol for troubleshooting

#### Realistic Network Investment
Many VMware environments running on 1GbE will require **complete network refresh** for Azure Local:

| **Current Network** | **Required Upgrade** | **Estimated Investment** |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 1GbE switches | 10/25GbE with DCB support | $15,000-50,000+ |
| Basic 10GbE | RDMA-capable 25/100GbE | $25,000-75,000+ |
| Legacy switching | Complete ToR refresh | $50,000-150,000+ |

**Critical Point**: Unlike Windows Server clusters that can work with existing network infrastructure, Azure Local **mandates** specific network capabilities that older environments typically lack.

* **Network Requirements:** Given the heavy reliance on east-west traffic for S2D replication, Azure Local has higher network demands. Realistically, 10 GbE is the minimum, and 25â€“100 Gb networks with RDMA are recommended for all-flash scenarios. Many older VMware deployments on 1 GbE won't meet Azure Local's performance needs. Thus, adopting HCI might involve upgrading network switches and NICs along with the servers. (Windows Server clusters with a SAN can sometimes get by with lower network throughput since the heavy lifting is offloaded to the SAN fabric; HCI pushes that onto the cluster network.)

* **Lifecycle and Updates:** Azure Local is delivered as an OS with frequent feature updates (semi-annual releases). OEM integrated systems often include streamlined update tools (e.g., firmware + driver + OS updates in one workflow). This is a benefit of buying into the validated model: you get a cohesive experience for patching. However, it also underscores that **older hardware may not be able to catch up** â€“ each new HCI release might drop support for out-of-date devices. (For instance, if an older RAID controller or NIC isn't re-certified by the OEM for the latest HCI version, you might not be able to upgrade that cluster without hardware changes. This is similar to what VMware is doing with vSphere â€“ more on that shortly.)

### Azure Local vs. Windows Server: Decision Matrix

| **Factor** | **Azure Local** | **Windows Server 2025** | **Decision Criteria** |
|------------|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Upfront Hardware Cost** | $200,000-500,000+ (new validated nodes) | $0-50,000 (minor upgrades) | Budget availability for major refresh |
| **Monthly Operating Cost** | $4,000-15,000+ (subscription fees) | $0-2,000 (maintenance only) | Preference for CapEx vs OpEx |
| **Timeline to Production** | 12-20 weeks (hardware + deployment) | 2-8 weeks (migration planning) | VMware deadline pressure |
| **Storage Investment Protection** | Cannot reuse existing SAN | Full SAN compatibility | Value of existing storage infrastructure |
| **Network Infrastructure** | Requires modern DCB-capable switching | Works with existing network gear | Network refresh budget availability |

### When Azure Local Makes Sense: Real Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Greenfield Deployment**
- New datacenter or major refresh already planned
- Budget allocated for modern infrastructure
- Strong Azure integration requirements
- **Verdict**: Azure Local is ideal

**Scenario 2: VMware Refugee with Recent Hardware**
- Servers purchased within last 3-4 years
- Existing SAN with remaining lifespan
- Tight budget constraints
- **Verdict**: Windows Server is the pragmatic choice

**Scenario 3: Distributed Branch Offices**
- Multiple small sites needing HCI
- Limited local IT expertise
- Cloud management requirements
- **Verdict**: Azure Local's validated appliances shine here

**Scenario 4: Mixed Environment Transition**
- Gradual VMware migration over 12-24 months
- Varying hardware ages across environment
- Need to maintain operations during transition
- **Verdict**: Windows Server provides necessary flexibility

In summary, Azure Local is a powerful solution if you're aiming for a **modern, cloud-connected datacenter** and are willing (and able) to invest in **new infrastructure that meets the spec**. It shines in scenarios like distributed branch office deployments, edge locations, or a fresh private cloud build that needs Azure integration. But for customers coming from VMware who have a lot of sunk cost in their current hardware, HCI's hardware requirements can be a tough pill â€“ it's essentially a **forklift upgrade** in many cases. This is exactly why we've been highlighting the Windows Server alternative in this series: it lets you incrementally adopt new technology on your timeline. Microsoft's marketing might paint Azure Local as the only forward path, but as we see, **WSFC/Hyper-V offers a more hardware-agnostic approach** that can be just as viable, especially during transition periods.
