### Architecture Decision Framework

**GPU Assignment Strategy:**
1. **Use GPU-P (Partitioning) when:**
   - Multiple VMs need GPU acceleration
   - Live migration capability is required
   - VDI or development workloads
   - Resource sharing and efficiency are priorities

2. **Use DDA (Discrete Device Assignment) when:**
   - Maximum GPU performance is required
   - AI training or high-performance computing workloads
   - Application requires full GPU access
   - Live migration is not critical

### Migration Planning Considerations

**What Continues Working:**
- Existing GPU-accelerated applications
- Current performance requirements and SLAs
- GPU resource planning and capacity models
- User access patterns for GPU workloads

**What Changes:**
- GPU resource allocation moves from profiles to partitions
- Live migration becomes available for shared GPU workloads
- Driver management simplifies with less strict version matching
- Licensing model changes from GRID to vGPU software licensing

**Migration Steps:**
1. Assess current vGPU profile usage and performance requirements
2. Map VMware vGPU profiles to Azure Local GPU-P partitions
3. Plan driver updates and licensing transitions
4. Test workload performance with GPU-P partitioning
5. Implement phased migration with live migration capabilities

### Cost and Licensing Impact

**GPU Licensing Changes:**

| Licensing Component | VMware Environment | Azure Local Environment | Cost Impact |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **NVIDIA GRID License** | Required for vGPU functionality | Not required for DDA | Cost reduction for DDA workloads |
| **NVIDIA vGPU Software** | GRID driver support subscription | Required for GPU-P only | Different licensing structure |
| **Virtualization License** | vSphere Enterprise Plus required | Azure Local subscription model | Subscription-based pricing |

### Bottom Line

Azure Local's GPU-P provides equivalent functionality to VMware vGPU with enhanced live migration capabilities and simplified driver management, while DDA offers dedicated GPU performance for high-performance workloads without vGPU licensing requirements.

> **Key Takeaway:** GPU workload migration to Azure Local maintains performance while gaining live migration capabilities and more flexible resource allocation through GPU partitioning.
