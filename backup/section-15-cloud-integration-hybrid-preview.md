## 15 Cloud Integration and Hybrid Services

### Your Cloud Integration Journey

Moving from VMware's limited cloud integration to Azure Local's native cloud-first architecture fundamentally changes how you can enhance your infrastructure with cloud services and hybrid capabilities.

> **Critical Integration Shift:** VMware vSphere requires third-party connectors and add-on solutions for cloud services. Azure Local provides **native Azure integration through Azure Arc**, fundamentally changing your operational model from on-premises-centric to cloud-native hybrid management.

### Identity Integration Evolution

**Active Directory vs Microsoft Entra ID Integration:**

Your current identity model evolves from basic Active Directory to cloud-enhanced identity management:

> **Important Correction:** Azure AD was rebranded to **Microsoft Entra ID** in August 2023. All references to "Azure AD" in this document should be understood as Microsoft Entra ID, which is the current product name for Microsoft's cloud identity service.

| Identity Capability | VMware vSphere | Azure Local Integration | Migration Impact |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Authentication** | Local AD domain authentication | **Microsoft Entra ID + hybrid identity sync** | **Single sign-on across cloud and on-premises** |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication** | Third-party MFA solutions required | **Native Microsoft Entra MFA integration** | **Built-in cloud MFA capabilities** |
| **Conditional Access** | Not available without third-party tools | **Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies** | **Policy-based access control** |
| **Privileged Access** | Local administrator accounts | **Microsoft Entra PIM (Privileged Identity Management)** | **Time-bound privileged access with approval workflows** |
| **Certificate Management** | Manual certificate lifecycle | **Azure Key Vault integration** | **Automated certificate management** |

**Reality Check on Azure Local Identity:**
- **Azure Local hosts** are automatically domain-joined during deployment to your Active Directory domain (using the Lifecycle Manager account)
- **VMs on Azure Local** can use traditional AD authentication, Microsoft Entra hybrid join, or pure cloud authentication depending on your configuration
- **Azure Arc integration** provides the cloud management layer and registers the cluster with Microsoft Entra ID for cloud services
- **Hybrid identity** is optional - you can choose to extend your on-premises AD to the cloud using Microsoft Entra Connect

**Authentication Options:**
1. **Traditional AD only:** Azure Local hosts join your on-premises Active Directory domain
2. **Hybrid identity:** Use Microsoft Entra Connect to synchronize identities between on-premises AD and Microsoft Entra ID
3. **Cloud services:** Azure Arc provides cloud management capabilities regardless of your identity choice

### Native Azure Arc Integration

**Beyond Traditional VM Management:**

Your VM management transforms from vCenter's isolated approach to Azure Arc's cloud-native capabilities:

**Azure Arc VM Management Benefits:**
- **Azure Portal Management:** Manage on-premises VMs through the same interface as Azure VMs
- **Azure RBAC:** Apply cloud-native role-based access control to on-premises infrastructure
- **Azure Policy:** Enforce governance policies consistently across hybrid environment
- **Azure Resource Manager:** Use ARM templates and Bicep for infrastructure as code
- **Azure Monitor:** Unified monitoring across on-premises and cloud resources

**Arc-Enabled Server Capabilities:**
- **System-assigned managed identity:** Secure access to Azure resources without storing credentials
- **Azure extensions:** Install Azure services directly on Azure Local hosts
- **Update management:** Cloud-managed patching and updates through Azure Update Manager
- **Security configuration:** Azure Security Center integration with continuous compliance monitoring

### Azure Hybrid Services Integration

**Built-In Azure Service Extensions:**

Azure Local includes native integration with Azure services that VMware requires separate solutions for:

| Service Category | VMware Approach | Azure Local Native Integration | Business Value |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| **Backup and Recovery** | Third-party backup vendors + cloud connectors | **Native Azure Backup + Azure Site Recovery** | **Simplified backup with cloud storage and global replication** |
| **Update Management** | WSUS + third-party patch management | **Azure Update Manager** | **Cloud-managed patching across all systems** |
| **Security and Compliance** | Third-party security tools + separate compliance | **Azure Security Center + Azure Policy** | **Continuous security assessment and automated compliance** |
| **Monitoring and Analytics** | vRealize Operations + third-party tools | **Native Azure Monitor integration** | **Cloud intelligence and machine learning-based insights** |

**Azure Backup Integration:**
- **Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS):** Backup Azure Local hosts and VMs directly to Azure
- **Azure Site Recovery:** Continuous replication from Azure Local to Azure with automated failover
- **Cloud storage targets:** Leverage Azure's global storage infrastructure for backup retention

**Azure Update Manager Benefits:**
- **Centralized update management:** View and manage updates across entire Azure Local fleet
- **Maintenance windows:** Schedule updates during business-appropriate times
- **Update compliance reporting:** Track update status across hybrid infrastructure

### Hybrid Networking Architecture

**Network Connectivity Options:**

Your network connectivity expands from traditional data center networking to hybrid cloud connectivity:

**ExpressRoute Integration:**
- **Private connectivity:** Direct, dedicated connection to Azure without internet transit
- **Consistent performance:** Predictable latency and bandwidth for hybrid workloads
- **Azure service access:** Direct access to Azure PaaS services over private connection
- **Global connectivity:** Connect multiple Azure Local sites through ExpressRoute Global Reach

**VPN Gateway Connectivity:**
- **Site-to-site VPN:** Secure connectivity for smaller deployments or backup connectivity

### Infrastructure as Code and DevOps Integration

**VMware Templates vs Azure Resource Manager:**

Your infrastructure deployment evolves from VM templates to cloud-native Infrastructure as Code:

**Current VMware Approach:**
- VM templates stored locally or in vCenter content library
- PowerCLI scripts for automated deployment
- Limited integration with modern DevOps pipelines
- Manual configuration management

**Azure Local DevOps Integration:**
- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates:** Declarative VM and infrastructure deployment
- **Bicep language:** Simplified ARM template creation with Azure Local support
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines:** Automated VM deployment using Azure Arc APIs
