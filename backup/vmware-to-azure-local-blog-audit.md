# Audit: VMware vSphere to Azure Local Blog (Operator Feature Mapping)

- File under review: `content/post/2025-07-29-vmware-vsphere-vs-azure-local-a-feature-comparison.md`
- Purpose: Record what needs to change or be verified. No edits applied to the blog file in this pass.
- Scope constraint: This review is based only on the provided blog content. All external verification is flagged as “Needs vendor verification.”
- Audience: Operators/admins migrating from VMware vSphere to Azure Local.
- Date: 2025-08-27

## Editorial framework checklist (status)

- Neutral, migration-first tone (not “which is better”): Mostly aligned; keep “industry shift” claims neutral (revise phrasing).
- Intros before tables: Present in Feature Overview; ensure in all major sections.
- Break up large tables with explanatory text: Partially met (Feature Overview OK). Apply across future sections.
- “Back to TOC” link placement: Present only after Feature Overview; standardize at end of each major section.
- Bottom Line/Key Takeaways callouts: Used in several sections; standardize for all.
- Blockquotes/callouts for important notes: Used; continue consistently for warnings/limits.
- Horizontal rule before each major “## X.0” section: Partially present; standardize.
- Mermaid diagrams for complex areas: Not present; add for management hierarchy and HA/DR paths.
- US English spell-check: Light pass needed.
- Heading structure: Avoid duplicate top-level headers (e.g., “# Section X …” + “## X …”); normalize levels.

## Critical factual verification hotspots (flagged, do not assert without vendor docs)

- Cluster limits and VM maxima (e.g., “16 hosts/cluster, 24TB VM RAM, 2048 vCPUs/VM”).
- “30-day offline mode”/check-in expectation for Azure Local/Arc control plane.
- GPU live migration support caveats (GPU-P/DDA, device/driver dependent).
- Management method boundaries: Arc-created VMs vs WAC-created VMs cross-manageability.
- Post-restore behavior: Restored VMs losing Arc identity/benefits and manageability scope.
- HA restart windows “15–25s” equivalency vs vSphere HA.
- Console access availability for Arc VMs in Azure Portal.
- SDN implementation and encapsulation (VXLAN vs NVGRE) for Azure Local SDN.
- Licensing phrasing (per-core/month, Azure Hybrid Benefit context).
- Cloud-Init and customization paths for Arc-enabled VMs.

---

## Duplicate/structural issues to resolve

- Duplicate Section 5: Two storage sections exist (“Storage Architecture & Features - Comprehensive Preview” and “Storage Architecture Deep Dive - Streamlined Preview”). Choose one canonical storage section; remove the other.
- AI humor/disclaimer paragraphs appear in Feature Overview/Section 5 Deep Dive; relocate to a footnote or remove for professional tone.
- Mixed heading levels: Remove the extra “# Section X: …” headers; keep a single H2 per major section (e.g., “## 1 Core Virtualization Platform”).

## Per-section status and actions

| Section | Status | Issues/Notes | Action Needed | Verification Needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Feature Overview | Draft | Good intro and table; “cluster failover (15–25s)” and limits stated; AI disclaimer at end breaks tone | Keep intro; standardize “Back to TOC”; remove/relocate AI disclaimer; add brief context bullets between table groups | Limits, failover timing, DRS vs manual load balancing phrasing |

| 5 Storage Architecture & Features | Needs correction | Claims “Primary Storage: Azure Blob,” “Azure Files/Disks” as local VM storage; conflates cloud services with on-prem; S2D noted later | Rewrite to make S2D/CSV the primary datastore; position Azure Backup/ASR as integrations; clarify external SAN/NAS support | S2D features (dedupe/compress/erasure coding) supportability; backup paths |

## High-priority fixes (before external verification)

1. Storage Section (5): Remove cloud storage as “primary” on-prem. Make S2D/CSV the default datastore; SAN/NAS optional; Azure Backup/ASR integrations separate.
2. Remove duplicate Section 5 “Deep Dive” placeholder or merge into single corrected storage section.
3. Remove/relocate AI disclaimer paragraphs to a short footnote or acknowledgments at the end, not in-section.
4. Standardize heading levels; drop the extra “# Section X …” titles; keep “## X …” format only.
5. Add “Back to TOC” link at the end of each major section.
6. Convert warnings (management method lock-in, restore identity loss) into consistent blockquotes and add Bottom Line callouts.
7. Add a short intro paragraph before each table (already done in Feature Overview; replicate pattern later).
8. Insert horizontal rules before each major section for scanability.
9. Add two Mermaid diagrams: (a) Management hierarchy/flows (Portal/Arc vs WAC vs tools), (b) HA/failover and maintenance flows.
10. Create Section 14 “Scalability and Limits” to centralize all numeric limits; change other sections to reference it.

## Notes for the next editing pass (when allowed to modify the blog)

- Apply the High-priority fixes above first, then proceed section-by-section to align editorial standards.
- As each claim is vendor-verified, add an inline reference number and populate the References section.
- Keep the tone operator-focused; avoid market commentary; remove subjective statements.
