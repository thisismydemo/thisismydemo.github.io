# Section 1: Core Virtualization Platform - Streamlined Preview

## 1 Core Virtualization Platform (Hypervisor & Infrastructure)

The foundation of your virtualization environment changes from ESXi to Azure Local (Hyper-V), maintaining enterprise-grade capabilities while integrating cloud services.

**Hypervisor:** VMware ESXi will be replaced by the **Azure Local operating system** (a specialized Hyper-V based OS). Both are bare-metal hypervisors with comparable performance and enterprise features. Hyper-V supports modern capabilities like virtual NUMA, nested virtualization, GPU acceleration, and memory management. For example, Azure Local supports GPU partitioning/pooling and even live migration of GPU-enabled VMs (similar to vMotion for VMs with GPUs). In practice, you should expect similar VM performance and stability from Hyper-V as with ESXi, as both are mature type-1 hypervisors.

**Clusters and Hosts:** In Azure Local, Hyper-V hosts are joined in a **Windows Failover Cluster** (managed by Azure Arc). This provides high availability akin to vSphere clusters. An Azure Local cluster can have 2–16 nodes; with 90 hosts, you would deploy multiple clusters (each cluster managed as a unit in Azure). Hosts in an Azure Local cluster use **Storage Spaces Direct (S2D)** for storage pooling – functionally similar to VMware vSAN in that each node's local disks form a shared, resilient storage pool across the cluster. If your VMware setup uses a SAN or NAS, Azure Local can accommodate that too (CSV volumes on external LUNs), but most deployments use S2D hyperconverged storage for best integration. Networking is provided by Hyper-V Virtual Switches; for advanced software-defined networking (comparable to NSX), Azure Local can integrate an **SDN layer** using VXLAN (optional), although many organizations simply use VLANs and the Hyper-V virtual switch.

**Licensing Note:** Azure Local uses a subscription-based licensing model (billed per physical core per month), unlike VMware's host licensing. Windows Server guest VMs still require licensing unless you use Azure Hybrid Benefits. It's important to factor this into planning, though the focus here is on technical features.

# Section 2: Management Tools and Interfaces - Streamlined Preview

## 2 Management Tools and Interfaces

Your centralized vCenter management transitions to a cloud-first approach with a clear management hierarchy that prioritizes Azure integration while maintaining local tools for specific scenarios.

**Primary: Azure Portal (Azure Arc Control Plane)** - Microsoft's official recommendation for Azure Local VM management. Once your clusters are registered with Azure Arc, the **Azure Portal** becomes your primary management interface. VMs created through the Azure Portal are "Arc VMs" with full Azure integration: RBAC permissions, Azure Hybrid Benefits, cloud monitoring, and unified management alongside Azure resources. Each Azure Local cluster appears as an Azure resource, enabling consistent governance across your hybrid estate. This replaces vCenter's centralized approach with cloud-native management that scales globally. In the Azure Portal, each Azure Local cluster appears as an Azure resource, and VMs are represented as "Arc VMs" resources. You can create, start/stop, delete VMs, configure virtual networks, and monitor resources all from the portal. Azure applies Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for these resources, allowing you to assign granular permissions. For your enterprise environment, you might give development teams access to manage their own VMs (self-service) in specific clusters without exposing the entire 6-cluster infrastructure – something vCenter also allowed with custom roles, now achieved via Azure RBAC on Arc-enabled VMs.

**Secondary: Azure CLI and PowerShell** - For automation and advanced operations. **Az PowerShell** and **Azure CLI** manage Arc-enabled resources and provide Infrastructure-as-Code capabilities through ARM templates and Bicep. Traditional **PowerShell modules** (Hyper-V, Failover Clustering) handle underlying platform operations. This combination replaces PowerCLI for scripting and automation scenarios.

**Third: Windows Admin Center (WAC)** - Microsoft's direction is to manage Azure Local through the Azure Portal but it can be used for managing existing Azure Local clusters when cloud connectivity is unavailable (not in a fully disconnected scenario), managing traditional Hyper-V VMs, VM console access, and troubleshooting. WAC provides local cluster management with features like live migration, VM console access, performance charts, and cluster administration. Creates "unmanaged VMs" that cannot be managed through Azure Portal. Use primarily for troubleshooting and when disconnected from Azure. WAC provides local cluster management similar to vCenter's interface, but creates "unmanaged VMs" that lack Azure Arc benefits and cannot be managed through Azure Portal. Microsoft's direction is to manage Azure Local through the Azure Portal, but WAC is still an important tool for cluster administration **when cloud connectivity is unavailable or for some advanced settings**. WAC provides a UI to manage Hyper-V hosts and clusters (much like vCenter) and includes features like live migration, VM console access, performance charts, etc. You'll likely use WAC during for troubleshooting scenarios. Over time, expect more functionality to shift to Azure Portal, but WAC remains available (just as vSphere has both new HTML5 client and legacy vSphere client – WAC is analogous to a local client, while Azure Portal is the cloud-based UI).

**Last Resort: Traditional Tools for Troubleshooting** - **Failover Cluster Manager** and **Hyper-V Manager** are the "old way" of managing Windows clusters. Use these only for deep troubleshooting, diagnostics, or when you need to "dig into the clusters" for low-level investigation. These tools help with cluster status, shared volumes, VM console access, and host-specific configurations when other tools don't provide the needed visibility. In day-to-day operations, you won't use them often (WAC and Azure Portal cover most needs), but they are handy for low-level troubleshooting. **Failover Cluster Manager** lets you see cluster status, cluster shared volumes, and can be used to move roles (VMs) between hosts, configure cluster settings, etc., much like vCenter's cluster view. **Hyper-V Manager** allows direct management of VMs on a single host (e.g. to adjust VM settings or connect to a VM console). For your team, using these will feel different from vCenter, but they are occasionally useful for diagnostics or if GUI access is needed in a pinch on a specific host. Most routine tasks, however, will be done in the Azure Portal or WAC.

**Automation Tools (PowerShell/CLI):** VMware admins transition from PowerCLI to PowerShell for Azure Local management. Hyper-V and Failover Clustering operations use PowerShell modules, while Azure Arc resources utilize **Az PowerShell** and **Azure CLI**. Infrastructure-as-Code approaches include ARM templates and Bicep files for VM deployment.

**Note on System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM):** While SCVMM provided centralized management for earlier Azure Stack HCI deployments, this comparison focuses on Azure Local's native management tools and Azure integration. SCVMM remains valid for organizations with existing System Center investments, but the Azure-native approach represents the strategic direction.

### Tool Usage Decision Matrix

**When to Use Each Management Interface:**

| Operation Type | Azure Portal | Windows Admin Center | PowerShell | Best Use Case |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------|------------|---------------|
| **VM Creation** | Arc VM creation | Create VM wizard | `New-VM` | Portal: Standard ops, WAC: Local/emergency |
| **Performance Monitoring** | Azure Monitor | WAC performance tab | `Get-Counter` | Portal: Analytics, WAC: Real-time troubleshooting |
| **Live Migration** | Not available | Move VM wizard | `Move-ClusterVirtualMachineRole` | WAC: Interactive, PS: Automation |
| **Security Management** | Azure Policy/Defender | Local security settings | Security cmdlets | Portal: Policy, WAC: Local config |
| **Network Configuration** | Azure networking | WAC network settings | Network cmdlets | Portal: SDN, WAC: Traditional networking |

### Automation Transition Guide

**Scripting Framework Changes:**

| Automation Task | PowerCLI Approach | PowerShell/Azure CLI Approach |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Bulk VM Operations** | `Get-VM \| ForEach-Object` | `Get-AzConnectedMachine \| ForEach-Object` |
| **Host Configuration** | `Get-VMHost \| Set-VMHostAdvancedConfiguration` | `Invoke-Command -ComputerName $Hosts` |
| **Resource Monitoring** | `Get-Stat -Entity $VM` | `Get-AzMetric -ResourceId $VM` |
| **Network Management** | `Get-VirtualSwitch \| New-VirtualPortGroup` | `New-NetAdapter \| Add-VMNetworkAdapter` |

### Critical Management Method Considerations

**Management Method Lock-in:** You cannot mix VM management approaches without losing functionality:

- **Azure Local Arc VMs** (created via Azure Portal): Managed through Azure Portal, CLI, PowerShell. **Cannot** be managed through Windows Admin Center.
- **Traditional Hyper-V VMs** (created via WAC/PowerShell): Managed through Windows Admin Center, Hyper-V Manager, PowerShell. **Cannot** be managed through Azure Portal.
- **Microsoft's recommendation:** "The recommended way to create and manage VMs on Azure Local is using the Azure Arc control plane."

**VM Restoration Limitations:** VMs restored from backup or Azure Site Recovery **lose their Azure Arc identity** and revert to traditional Hyper-V VMs:
- Restored VMs can only be managed through Windows Admin Center, Hyper-V Manager, or PowerShell
- Loss of Azure Portal management, RBAC permissions, and Azure Hybrid Benefits  
- Plan backup/DR procedures accounting for potential loss of Azure management capabilities

**Feature Gaps:** Arc VMs have limited Windows Admin Center support (marked with ❌ in Microsoft comparison tables), while WAC-created VMs have "limited manageability from the Azure Arc control plane, and fewer Azure Hybrid Benefits."

 > **Key Takeaway:** Azure Portal first, Azure CLI/PowerShell for automation, Windows Admin Center when cloud unavailable, traditional tools for troubleshooting only. Choose your VM management method carefully—it affects long-term manageability and disaster recovery.

**Bottom Line:** Azure Local's management hierarchy prioritizes cloud integration over local control. While this requires learning new Azure-native workflows instead of vCenter's unified approach, the result is enhanced RBAC, global scalability, and seamless hybrid cloud operations. Success depends on understanding when to use each tool and the irreversible consequences of management method choices.

# Section 3: VM Lifecycle Operations - Streamlined Preview

## 3 Virtual Machine Lifecycle Operations

Daily VM management remains familiar with equivalent capabilities for provisioning, migration, and maintenance operations.

Daily VM operations in Azure Local will feel familiar, with analogous features to vSphere for creating, running, and modifying virtual machines:

**VM Provisioning & Templates:** In vSphere, you might clone from templates. Azure Local doesn't use vCenter templates in the same way, but you have a few options:

- Through Azure Portal, you can create a new VM (Arc VM) and specify an image or existing VHD. Azure Local can integrate with Azure's image gallery, or you can keep a library of golden VHD(X) images (similar to templates) on a file share. While not as GUI-integrated as vCenter templates, using scripting or WAC's "Create VM from existing disk" achieves a similar result. Additionally, Azure Resource Manager templates can define a VM shape (vCPU, memory, OS image, etc.) for consistent deployment across clusters.
- **Sysprep and clone:** You can sysprep a VM, shut it down, and copy its VHDX to use as a master image. This is analogous to how many admins create VMware templates (which are essentially VMs marked as template).
- Azure Local also supports **Cloud-Init** for Linux and **VM customization** tasks via Azure Arc, which can inject configuration into new VMs similar to VMware guest customization.

**Live Migration (vMotion):** VMware's vMotion allows moving running VMs between hosts with no downtime. Hyper-V's equivalent is **Live Migration**, and it's a core feature of Azure Local clusters. You can initiate a live migration through WAC or Failover Cluster Manager (by moving the VM role to another node) – the VM continues running during the move, just like vMotion. Live Migration performance and limits are comparable to vMotion; it uses a dedicated network (or networks) to transfer memory and state. In practice, you'll put a host into "**pause/drain roles**" mode (maintenance mode) which automatically live-migrates its VMs to other hosts, allowing patching or hardware maintenance – similar to vSphere's maintenance mode + DRS.

**VM Snapshots (Checkpoints):** VMware "snapshots" have a parallel in Hyper-V called **checkpoints**. You can take a checkpoint of a VM's state, do changes or backups, and later apply or discard it. Standard checkpoints save the VM's disk and memory state. Azure Local supports both standard and "production" checkpoints (production checkpoints use VSS in the guest to create a disk-consistent point-in-time without saving memory, ideal for backups). The experience is similar: you can create a checkpoint in WAC or PowerShell, and if needed, revert (apply) that checkpoint to roll back a VM.

**Cloning and VM Copies:** If you need to duplicate a VM, the process isn't one-click clone as in vCenter, but it's straightforward: you can export a VM (which copies its VHDX and config) and import it as a new VM. WAC has an **"Export VM"** action, or you can use PowerShell cmdlets to accomplish a clone. Alternatively, as mentioned, keep a library of prepared images for quick deployment.

**VM Tools and Integration Services:** In vSphere, VMs run VMware Tools for optimized drivers and guest OS integration. Azure Local uses **Hyper-V Integration Services** – analogous tools providing driver optimization (for storage, network, etc.) and guest integration (for time sync, shutdown, heartbeat, VSS, etc.). The good news is that modern Windows and Linux OSs include Hyper-V integration components by default (Windows has them built-in, Linux distributions have Hyper-V drivers in the kernel).

**Console Access:** vSphere offers a web console or remote console to VMs. With Azure Local, if you're using the Azure Portal, there isn't a built-in VM console viewer for Arc VMs at this time – you would typically connect via RDP or SSH as you would for any server. However, using Windows Admin Center, you *do* have an HTML5 VM console for each VM (it uses VMConnect behind the scenes).

**Resource Allocation & Performance Settings:** All the VM hardware settings you're used to in VMware exist in Hyper-V, though sometimes under different names. For CPU and memory: you can set vCPUs, reserve or limit CPU capacity (via Hyper-V "virtual machine reserve" or setting processor weight, analogous to VMware shares/reservations). Memory can be fixed or "Dynamic Memory" – Hyper-V's form of memory overcommitment. Dynamic Memory can automatically adjust a VM's memory between a minimum and maximum, based on demand, which is somewhat comparable to VMware's ballooning/overcommit.

**Bottom Line:** Azure Local VM lifecycle operations provide equivalent functionality to vSphere with different management interfaces. While VMware consolidates most operations in vCenter, Azure Local splits between cloud-based Azure Portal for Arc VMs and local Windows Admin Center for direct management. Your team will need to adapt to PowerShell-centric automation and distributed management tools, but core VM operations remain familiar with similar performance settings and resource allocation options.

# Section 4: High Availability, Clustering & Application Protection - Streamlined Preview

## 4 High Availability, Clustering & Application Protection

VM uptime protection evolves from ESXi HA/DRS to Windows Failover Clustering with integrated Azure services for health monitoring.

Maintaining VM uptime during host failures or maintenance is just as crucial in Azure Local as in vSphere, and similar mechanisms exist:

**High Availability Architecture:** In Azure Local, Hyper-V hosts are joined in a **Windows Failover Cluster** (managed by Azure Arc). This provides high availability akin to vSphere clusters. When a host fails, the cluster automatically restarts VMs on surviving hosts - similar to VMware HA. The main difference is that Azure Local doesn't have DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler) for automatic load balancing. Instead, you manually live-migrate VMs or create PowerShell scripts to balance load across hosts.

**Cluster Features Comparison:**
- **VMware HA:** Automatically restarts VMs after host failure with admission control
- **Azure Local Clustering:** Failover Clustering automatically restarts VMs with quorum-based protection
- **VMware DRS:** Automatically balances VMs across hosts based on resource utilization
- **Azure Local:** Manual live migration or PowerShell-based load balancing required

**Application-Level Protection:** Just like vSphere, you can implement application clustering (SQL Server Availability Groups, Windows Failover Clustering for applications) on top of the VM infrastructure. Azure Local supports guest clustering scenarios with shared storage via CSV volumes.

**Maintenance Procedures:** Similar to vSphere maintenance mode, you can put Azure Local hosts into "pause/drain" mode, which automatically live-migrates VMs to other hosts before maintenance. This is done through Windows Admin Center or PowerShell commands. Volume management (creating volumes, resizing, etc.) is handled separately via WAC or PowerShell for operational workflows.

**Recovery Time Differences:** Azure Local cluster failover typically takes 15-25 seconds to restart VMs after host failure, compared to VMware HA's similar timeframe. For zero-downtime scenarios, VMware's Fault Tolerance (FT) capability doesn't have an Azure Local equivalent - you rely on application-level HA instead.

**Fault Tolerance vs High Availability Reality:** Understanding the difference between VMware's protection options and Azure Local's approach is crucial for setting proper expectations:

| Protection Method | VMware Implementation | Azure Local Implementation | Business Impact |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **VM Restart (Most Common)** | vSphere HA (15-30 seconds) | Cluster Failover (15-25 seconds) | Equivalent brief outage |
| **Zero Downtime (Niche)** | Fault Tolerance (0 seconds) | Not available - use application clustering | FT users lose zero-downtime capability |
| **Live Migration** | vMotion (0 seconds) | Live Migration (0 seconds) | Equivalent planned maintenance capability |

**Resource Consumption Impact:** If you used VMware FT, you consumed 200% CPU and memory resources for zero-downtime protection. Azure Local cluster failover uses only ~10% cluster overhead, allowing higher VM consolidation ratios but with brief restart windows instead of zero-downtime protection.

**Application Protection Strategy Evolution:** VMware Application HA and monitoring translates to Windows Server Failover Clustering with different operational approaches:

**Application Monitoring Translation:**
- **VMware App HA:** Integrated vCenter monitoring with automatic service restart
- **Azure Local WSFC:** Generic Application cluster roles with PowerShell health check scripts
- **SQL Server Protection:** Shifts from vSphere HA VM restart to SQL Always On Availability Groups for database-level failover

**Multi-Tier Application Dependencies:** Application startup sequencing and VM placement change significantly:
- **VMware Approach:** DRS anti-affinity rules ensure VMs run on different hosts, Application HA groups manage startup ordering
- **Azure Local Approach:** Manual VM placement policies or PowerShell automation, WSFC resource dependencies manage application sequencing

**Operational Learning Curve:** The team should be prepared for a shift from vCenter's unified interface to PowerShell-based cluster management for advanced scenarios. This includes monitoring new cluster metrics which Azure Monitor Insights will help with, replacing vSphere's centralized monitoring approach.

**Bottom Line:** Azure Local provides equivalent VM-level high availability through Windows Failover Clustering for the majority of VMware customers who used vSphere HA. However, customers who relied on VMware Fault Tolerance lose zero-downtime protection and must implement application-level clustering instead. Live migration capabilities remain equivalent for planned maintenance scenarios, while DRS automatic load balancing requires manual management or PowerShell automation in Azure Local.

# Section 5: Storage Architecture & Features - Comprehensive Preview

## 5 Storage Architecture & Features

Azure Local's storage architecture combines familiar and new elements, requiring adjustments in management and operations for VMware admins.

Azure Local's storage subsystem is one of its most complex but powerful aspects, blending traditional and cloud-native technologies. Here's an overview of how it compares to VMware's storage solutions:

**Primary Storage: Azure Blob Storage** - At the core of Azure Local is **Azure Blob Storage**, Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob Storage is used for storing unstructured data, backups, and VM disks in a highly scalable and durable manner. It replaces the need for traditional SAN/NAS in many scenarios, especially for unstructured data and backups. For VMware admins, think of Blob Storage as a combination of your datastore and backup target, but with a different management paradigm.

**Secondary Storage: Azure Files and Azure Disks** - In addition to Blob Storage, Azure Local utilizes **Azure Files** (fully managed file shares in the cloud) and **Azure Disks** (managed disks for VMs). Azure Files is similar to SMB/NFS shares but hosted on Azure, while Azure Disks are block-level storage volumes attached to VMs. These provide additional options for application data, file shares, and OS disks.

**Storage Spaces Direct (S2D):** Azure Local uses **Storage Spaces Direct (S2D)** to create a hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) for VMs. S2D pools together local disks from multiple hosts to create a resilient, high-performance storage solution. This is similar in concept to VMware's vSAN, but with different implementation and management. S2D is managed through Windows Admin Center or PowerShell, and offers features like deduplication, compression, and erasure coding.

**VMware vSAN Comparison:** For organizations familiar with VMware's vSAN, Azure's S2D offers similar hyper-converged capabilities but with key differences:
- **Integration with Azure Services:** S2D is deeply integrated with Azure's cloud services, enabling features like Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, and cloud-tiering for backups. vSAN is more standalone, integrated primarily with VMware's ecosystem.
- **Management Interface:** S2D is managed through Windows Admin Center or PowerShell, while vSAN is managed through vSphere. This represents a significant shift for VMware admins used to vCenter.
- **Licensing and Cost:** S2D is included with Azure Local subscriptions, whereas vSAN requires separate licensing. However, consider the overall cost implications of Azure services consumption.

**Networking Considerations:** Networking in Azure Local leverages **Hyper-V Virtual Switches** and can be extended with Azure's SDN capabilities. Key points include:
- **Virtual Switch Types:** Similar to vSphere, you have external, internal, and private virtual switches. External switches connect to the physical network, internal switches allow communication between VMs on the same host, and private switches are for VM-to-VM communication only.
- **SDN Integration:** Azure Local can integrate with Azure's SDN for advanced networking features like network security groups, application security groups, and virtual network peering. This is comparable to VMware NSX but with Azure's management model.

**Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Azure Local simplifies backup and DR with integrated Azure services:
- **Azure Backup:** Simplified backup solution for VMs, files, and applications, directly integrated into the Azure Portal.
- **Azure Site Recovery (ASR):** For disaster recovery, ASR enables replication and failover of VMs to Azure, providing a robust DR solution.

**Operational Management Changes:** Managing storage in Azure Local requires adapting to new tools and concepts:
- **Azure Portal:** Central to managing Azure resources, including storage. You'll manage Blob Storage, Files, and Disks here.
- **Windows Admin Center:** Used for managing S2D, Hyper-V hosts, and traditional storage tasks.
- **PowerShell and Azure CLI:** Essential for automation and advanced management tasks.

**Bottom Line:** Azure Local's storage architecture represents a shift to cloud-integrated, hyper-converged infrastructure for many organizations. While there are parallels to VMware's storage solutions, the management interfaces, underlying technologies, and operational paradigms differ significantly. Success in this new environment hinges on understanding these differences and adapting management practices accordingly.

*This section provides a comprehensive overview of Azure Local's storage architecture, comparing it with VMware's storage solutions and highlighting key considerations for management and operations.*

# Section 5: Storage Architecture Deep Dive - Streamlined Preview

## 5 Storage Architecture Deep Dive

Your VMware storage architecture—whether external SAN, vSAN, or hybrid—transitions to Storage Spaces Direct with fundamental changes in storage presentation, management, and operational workflows.

Understanding how traditional storage concepts translate to Azure Local helps you plan storage performance, capacity, and infrastructure changes regardless of your current VMware storage approach.

### Storage Architecture Migration Paths

**Core Storage Philosophy Evolution:** Azure Local standardizes on Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) as the primary storage approach, representing a shift from diverse VMware storage options to a unified software-defined storage model.

Your current VMware storage architecture maps to Azure Local as follows:

| Current VMware Storage | Azure Local Approach | Migration Complexity | Operational Impact |
|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **External FC/iSCSI SAN** | Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) | High - Architecture change | Complete storage workflow transformation |
| **vSAN HCI** | Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) | Medium - Concept translation | Management tool and policy changes |
| **Hybrid (SAN + vSAN)** | Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) | High - Consolidation required | Unified storage management approach |
| **NFS/NAS** | Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) | High - Protocol change | File service architecture redesign |

### External SAN → Storage Spaces Direct Transformation

**Traditional SAN Architecture Changes:** Most VMware customers using external SAN arrays face the most significant storage architecture changes when moving to Azure Local.

**Storage Infrastructure Transformation:**

| Traditional SAN Approach | Azure Local S2D Approach | Infrastructure Change |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Storage Array** | Server-based storage pool | Hardware procurement shifts from arrays to servers |
| **FC/iSCSI Network** | Ethernet-based storage network | Network infrastructure simplification |
| **LUN Presentation** | Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV) | Storage presentation method changes |
| **Array Management** | PowerShell/WAC storage management | Management tool and skillset evolution |
| **RAID Controllers** | Software-defined resilience | Hardware dependency reduction |

**Operational Workflow Changes:**
- **LUN Creation:** Array-based LUN carving → S2D volume creation via PowerShell/WAC
- **Storage Monitoring:** Array management consoles → Windows Storage Health Service
- **Performance Tuning:** Array cache/tier policies → S2D cache and resiliency policies
- **Capacity Planning:** Array expansion → Node addition for capacity/performance scaling

**Converged Mode Option:** Azure Local supports converged mode where you can continue using existing SAN arrays as Cluster Shared Volumes, but you lose cloud integration benefits and most customers migrate to S2D for operational simplification.

### vSAN → Storage Spaces Direct Architectural Translation

**For customers currently using vSAN:** The transition involves conceptual translation rather than fundamental architecture change, as both are software-defined storage approaches.

| Storage Component | vSAN | Storage Spaces Direct | Architecture Impact |
|-------------------|------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Storage Pooling** | vSAN cluster-wide storage pool | S2D cluster-shared volumes | Similar abstraction layer |
| **Data Placement** | vSAN object placement | S2D mirror/parity placement | Different algorithms, same resilience |
| **Cache Tier** | vSAN read/write cache | S2D cache with NVMe/SSD | Equivalent performance acceleration |
| **Capacity Tier** | vSAN capacity drives | S2D capacity drives | Standard HDD/SSD support |
| **Resiliency** | FTT policies (RAID-1/5/6) | Mirror/parity configurations | Different terminology, same protection |

**vSAN Policy Translation:** Your existing vSAN storage policies map to S2D resiliency settings:

| Workload Type | vSAN Policy | S2D Configuration | Capacity Efficiency |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **High Performance** | FTT=1, RAID-1 + All-Flash | Two-way mirror + NVMe cache | 50% usable capacity |
| **Balanced** | FTT=1, RAID-5 + Hybrid | Mirror-accelerated parity | 66% usable capacity |
| **Capacity Optimized** | FTT=2, RAID-6 + Archive | Dual parity + compression | 75% usable capacity |

### Storage Presentation and Management Changes

**VMFS vs CSV Architecture:** The fundamental change from VMware's VMFS datastore model to Windows Cluster Shared Volumes affects how storage is presented and managed.

**Storage Presentation Comparison:**

| Storage Concept | VMware Approach | Azure Local Approach | Operational Difference |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Storage Abstraction** | VMFS datastores | Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV) | Different file system and presentation |
| **VM Storage Files** | .vmdk on VMFS | .vhdx on NTFS/ReFS | Different file formats and management |
| **Storage Policies** | vSphere storage policies | S2D resiliency settings | Different terminology, similar concepts |
| **Thin Provisioning** | VMFS thin disks | VHDX dynamically expanding | Equivalent functionality, different implementation |
| **Storage vMotion** | Cross-datastore migration | CSV live migration | Similar capability, different underlying mechanism |

### Performance Characteristics and Planning

**Storage Performance Translation:** Understanding performance differences helps with capacity planning and architecture decisions.

| Performance Metric | External SAN | vSAN All-Flash | S2D All-Flash | Planning Consideration |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **IOPS Capability** | Array-dependent | 100K+ per host | 150K+ per host | S2D often provides superior per-host performance |
| **Latency** | Network + array latency | Sub-millisecond | Sub-millisecond | Network latency elimination with S2D |
| **Throughput** | FC/iSCSI limited | 2GB/s+ per host | 3GB/s+ per host | Higher bandwidth potential with S2D |
| **Scalability** | Array capacity limits | 64 hosts max | 16 hosts per cluster | Different scale-out approaches |

### Storage Management Tool Evolution

**Management Workflow Changes:** Storage administration transitions from array-specific tools to Windows-native management interfaces.

| Task | Traditional SAN | vSAN Management | S2D Management | Skill Set Impact |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Volume Creation** | Array management console | vSphere Client | WAC/PowerShell | PowerShell scripting skills required |
| **Health Monitoring** | Array monitoring tools | vSAN health service | Storage Health Service | Windows event log integration |
| **Performance Analytics** | Array performance tools | vSAN performance | Storage Performance Monitor | Native Windows performance counters |
| **Policy Configuration** | Array policy/tier settings | vSphere Client | WAC/PowerShell | Policy-based management evolution |
| **Capacity Planning** | Array capacity planning | vSAN capacity planner | S2D sizing tools | Microsoft sizing methodologies |

### Storage Transition Planning and Strategy

**Migration Planning Approach:** Different VMware storage architectures require different transition strategies and timelines.

**External SAN Migration Strategy:**
1. **Infrastructure Assessment:** Evaluate existing SAN capacity, performance, and lifecycle status
2. **S2D Sizing:** Plan server hardware to meet current storage performance and capacity requirements  
3. **Network Planning:** Design Ethernet-based storage network to replace FC/iSCSI infrastructure
4. **Skills Development:** Train storage teams on PowerShell and Windows storage management
5. **Phased Migration:** Plan data migration from SAN to S2D during maintenance windows

**vSAN Migration Strategy:**
1. **Policy Mapping:** Document existing vSAN storage policies and map to S2D resiliency settings
2. **Performance Validation:** Ensure S2D configuration meets or exceeds current vSAN performance
3. **Management Training:** Transition from vSphere Client to Windows Admin Center/PowerShell workflows
4. **Tool Integration:** Reconfigure monitoring and automation tools for S2D management

### Storage Networking and Infrastructure Changes

**Network Architecture Evolution:** Storage networking requirements change significantly, especially for external SAN customers.

| Network Aspect | Traditional SAN | vSAN | Azure Local S2D |
|-----------------|-----------------|------|-----------------|
| **Storage Protocol** | FC/iSCSI | vSAN network | Ethernet SMB3 |
| **Network Isolation** | FC fabric or iSCSI VLAN | vSAN traffic isolation | Storage intent networks |
| **Redundancy** | Dual FC paths or iSCSI multipath | vSAN network redundancy | NIC teaming or SR-IOV |
| **Bandwidth Planning** | FC/iSCSI link speeds | 10GbE+ for vSAN | 25GbE+ recommended for S2D |

### Bottom Line

Storage Spaces Direct represents a fundamental shift from diverse VMware storage approaches to a unified software-defined storage model. External SAN customers face the most significant architectural changes, while vSAN customers experience more of a management and tooling transition. Both paths lead to simplified storage management with Windows-native tools and often superior performance characteristics.

> **Key Takeaway:** Whether coming from external SAN or vSAN, Azure Local consolidates storage management into a single S2D approach that eliminates storage array dependencies while providing equivalent or better performance through software-defined storage.

*This section focuses purely on storage architecture fundamentals, leaving backup integration details for Section 6 and disaster recovery storage topics for Section 7.*

# Section 6: Backup & Data Protection - Streamlined Preview

## 6 Backup & Data Protection

Your existing backup solutions transition from VMware VADP framework to Hyper-V VSS integration with equivalent backup capabilities but important restore behavior differences for Azure Local Arc-enabled VMs.

**Platform-Agnostic Backup Reality:** Backup is fundamentally a third-party solution challenge, not a platform-specific one. However, the integration methods, APIs, and critically, the restore behaviors change significantly between VMware and Azure Local environments.

### Backup Integration Architecture Changes

**VMware vs Azure Local Backup Integration:**

| Backup Component | VMware Integration | Azure Local Integration | Operational Impact |
|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| **Backup APIs** | VADP (vStorage APIs for Data Protection) | VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) + WMI | Different integration methods, same functionality |
| **Change Tracking** | CBT (Changed Block Tracking) | RCT (Resilient Change Tracking) | More reliable change tracking with RCT |
| **Snapshot Method** | vSphere snapshots via VADP | Hyper-V checkpoints via VSS | Native Windows integration |
| **Application Quiescing** | VMware Tools VSS trigger | Hyper-V Integration Services VSS | More reliable Windows application integration |

### Third-Party Backup Vendor Compatibility

**Major Backup Vendor Support:** All major backup vendors support Hyper-V/Azure Local with equivalent functionality to their VMware implementations:

- **Veeam:** Full Azure Stack HCI support with Hyper-V integration modules
- **Commvault:** Dedicated Hyper-V protection capabilities with Azure Local compatibility
- **Rubrik:** Native Azure Stack HCI integration with cloud-first architecture
- **Veritas NetBackup:** Comprehensive Hyper-V support for Azure Local environments
- **Other Enterprise Vendors:** Similar Hyper-V support across major backup solutions

**Backup Process Equivalency:** While the underlying APIs differ, backup functionality remains equivalent:
- **Application-consistent backups** through VSS integration
- **Incremental backup capabilities** via Resilient Change Tracking
- **File-level restore capabilities** from VM backups
- **Cross-platform restore options** for disaster recovery scenarios

### Microsoft Native Backup Options

**Azure Backup Server (MABS):** Microsoft provides Azure Backup Server as a native solution for Azure Local environments. MABS v3 UR2+ offers:

- **Host-level backup** via Hyper-V VSS writer integration
- **Azure cloud integration** for hybrid backup and offsite protection
- **Application-aware backups** through VSS in Windows guests
- **Item-level recovery** capabilities for files and folders
- **No additional licensing costs** beyond Azure storage consumption

### CRITICAL RESTORE BEHAVIOR DIFFERENCES

**Azure Local Arc VM Restore Limitations:** This is the most significant difference that affects operational procedures:

| Restore Scenario | Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior | Business Impact |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Arc VM Host-Level Restore** | Restore as Arc-enabled VM | **Restores as standard Hyper-V VM** | Loss of Azure Arc integration and cloud management |
| **Arc VM Alternate Location Recovery** | Arc VM on different host | **Standard Hyper-V VM only** | Manual Azure Arc re-enablement required |
| **Cross-Cluster Restore** | Arc VM on different cluster | **Hyper-V VM without Arc integration** | Complete loss of Azure portal management |

**Microsoft Documentation Quote:**
> *"There's limited support for Alternate location recovery (ALR) for Arc VMs. The VM is recovered as a Hyper-V VM, instead of an Arc VM. Currently, conversion of Hyper-V VMs to Arc VMs isn't supported once you create them."*

**Critical Operational Implications:**
1. **Azure Portal Management Loss:** Restored VMs lose Azure portal visibility and management capabilities
2. **Azure Policy Compliance:** Restored VMs fall out of Azure policy and governance frameworks
3. **Azure Monitoring Integration:** Loss of Azure Monitor integration and cloud-based logging
4. **No Re-Arc Conversion:** Cannot convert restored Hyper-V VMs back to Arc-enabled VMs after restore
5. **Manual Recreation Required:** Must create new Arc-enabled VMs and migrate data to restore full functionality

### Backup Strategy Recommendations

**Mixed VM Environment Planning:**
- **Standard Hyper-V VMs:** Full backup/restore capability with no limitations
- **Arc-enabled VMs:** Backup works normally, but plan for Hyper-V-only recovery
- **Critical Arc VMs:** Consider application-level backup/recovery to maintain Arc integration

**Operational Procedures:**
- **Document Arc VM Dependencies:** Identify which VMs require Azure Arc integration
- **Test Restore Procedures:** Validate recovery workflows and Arc VM recreation processes
- **Azure Resource Inventory:** Maintain automation scripts to recreate Arc VM configurations
- **Hybrid Approach:** Use guest-level backup for critical Arc VMs to avoid Arc integration loss

### Azure Integration Benefits

**Hybrid Backup Capabilities:** Azure Local provides enhanced cloud integration compared to traditional VMware environments:
- **Azure cloud storage targets** for offsite backup without additional configuration
- **Cross-region replication** capabilities through Azure's global infrastructure
- **Integrated monitoring** through Azure Monitor for backup job visibility
- **Cost optimization** through Azure storage tiers and lifecycle management

**Bottom Line:** While backup processes largely remain the same with equivalent vendor support, the critical difference is restore behavior for Arc-enabled VMs. Plan for Azure Local Arc VMs to restore as standard Hyper-V VMs and develop procedures to handle the loss of Azure Arc integration during recovery scenarios.

# Section 7: Disaster Recovery - Comprehensive Preview

## 7 Disaster Recovery

Your disaster recovery approach transitions from VMware-centric solutions to Azure-native services, enabling flexible, cloud-integrated recovery options with Azure Site Recovery.

**Core DR Components Comparison:**
- **VMware:** Relies on vSphere Replication, Site Recovery Manager (SRM), and potentially third-party tools for DR orchestration and failover testing.
- **Azure Local:** Leverages Azure Site Recovery (ASR) for replication, failover, and failback, integrated with Azure's cloud services for streamlined management and scalability.

**Key Differences and Considerations:**
- **Integration with Cloud:** Azure's DR solution is natively integrated with its cloud platform, offering features like geo-redundant storage, cross-region replication, and seamless failover to Azure.
- **Management Interface:** DR management shifts from vSphere/HTML5 client to Azure Portal and PowerShell, aligning with Azure's broader management paradigm.
- **Licensing and Costs:** ASR is billed based on the number of protected instances and the amount of data transferred, differing from VMware's licensing model.

**Azure Site Recovery Overview:**
- **Replication:** ASR replicates VMs to Azure or between on-premises sites and Azure, using hypervisor-level replication for both VMware and Hyper-V environments.
- **Failover and Failback:** Orchestrated through the Azure Portal, allowing for test failovers, planned migrations, and unplanned failover scenarios.
- **Recovery Plans:** ASR enables the creation of recovery plans that automate the failover and failback processes, including the sequencing of VM startups.

**Operational Changes for DR:**
- **New Tools and Interfaces:** Familiarize with Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, and ASR-specific interfaces for managing DR.
- **Process Re-engineering:** Update DR processes to align with ASR's capabilities, such as using recovery plans and Azure's monitoring tools.
- **Testing and Validation:** Regularly test DR plans using ASR's test failover feature to ensure reliability and performance.

**VMware to Azure DR Transition Steps:**
1. **Assess Current DR Setup:** Document existing DR architecture, including replication methods, failover processes, and tools used.
2. **Design Azure DR Architecture:** Plan the target DR architecture in Azure, considering network topology, resource allocation, and security.
3. **Configure Azure Site Recovery:** Set up ASR for the VMs and applications identified for disaster recovery, including replication and recovery plans.
4. **Update Operational Procedures:** Revise DR runbooks and operational procedures to align with the new Azure-based DR solution.
5. **Train Staff:** Provide training for IT staff on Azure DR tools, ASR management, and new operational procedures.
6. **Conduct DR Drills:** Regularly perform disaster recovery drills to test the effectiveness of the DR plan and make adjustments as necessary.

**Bottom Line:** Transitioning disaster recovery from VMware to Azure Local involves adopting Azure Site Recovery and rethinking DR processes to leverage cloud capabilities. While there is a learning curve and process re-engineering required, the result is a more flexible, scalable, and cloud-integrated disaster recovery solution.

# Section 16: Migration Planning and Strategy - Streamlined Preview

## 16 Migration Planning and Strategy

Your VMware-to-Azure Local migration requires understanding Azure Migrate tools, cluster architecture limits, and phased deployment strategies that minimize business disruption while ensuring operational continuity.

Understanding the official migration tools and architectural constraints helps you plan the transition from VMware to Azure Local with realistic timelines and minimal service impact.

### Migration Tools and Process (Verified)

**Primary Migration Tool: Azure Migrate for Azure Local (Preview)**

Azure Migrate is the official Microsoft-supported migration tool for VMware to Azure Local migrations:

| Migration Capability | Azure Migrate Features | Migration Benefit |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Agentless Migration** | No VMDK conversion or VM preparation required | Simplified process without guest OS changes |
| **Local Data Flow** | Migration traffic stays between on-premises environments | Reduced bandwidth requirements and faster transfers |
| **Azure Portal Control** | Cloud-based migration orchestration and tracking | Centralized migration management and progress monitoring |
| **Minimal Downtime** | Replication with brief cutover windows | Business continuity during migration |

**Migration Process (Four Phases):**
1. **Prepare:** Deploy and register Azure Local, create Azure Migrate project
2. **Discover:** Deploy source appliance on VMware to discover VMs
3. **Replicate:** Deploy target appliance on Azure Local, begin VM replication
4. **Migrate & Verify:** Complete cutover and validate VM functionality

**Alternative Migration Options:**
| Migration Tool | Use Case | Migration Method | Business Impact |
|----------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **System Center VMM** | Enterprise environments with existing SCVMM | V2V conversion through VMM console | Familiar interface for VMM users |
| **Third-Party Tools** | Veeam, Commvault specialized migrations | Vendor-specific migration features | Additional licensing costs, specialized capabilities |

### Architectural Impact on Migration Planning

**Critical Scale Consideration: 16-Host Cluster Limit (Identical to VMware)**

Both VMware vSphere and Azure Local have identical 16-host per cluster limits:

**Your Environment Architecture:**
- **Current:** 90+ hosts across multiple vSphere clusters (6+ clusters required)
- **Target:** 6+ Azure Local clusters (maximum 16 hosts each) - identical cluster count

**Migration Complexity Implications:**

| Migration Approach | Architecture Impact | Risk Level | Timeline Consideration |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Parallel Build** | Build all 6 clusters simultaneously | Lower risk, higher hardware cost | 6-8 months with sufficient hardware |
| **Phased Replacement** | Replace one cluster at a time | Medium risk, lower hardware cost | 12-18 months gradual migration |
| **Hybrid Period** | Run both platforms during transition | Higher complexity, operational overhead | 8-12 months with dual management |

**Cross-Cluster Planning Impact:** Unlike VMware where VMs can vMotion between clusters under the same vCenter, Azure Local clusters operate independently. Plan VM placement carefully as VMs stay within their assigned cluster permanently.

### Migration Strategy Decision Framework

**Cluster-by-Cluster Migration Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (Months 1-2)**
- Application dependency mapping across current clusters
- Performance baseline establishment for 2,500+ VMs  
- Network connectivity planning between VMware and Azure Local environments
- Azure Migrate project setup and appliance deployment

**Phase 2: Pilot Cluster Migration (Months 3-4)**
- Select least critical cluster for initial migration
- Test Azure Migrate tools and processes at scale
- Validate performance and operational procedures
- Refine migration procedures based on lessons learned

**Phase 3: Production Migration Phases (Months 5-12)**  
- Migrate clusters in business priority order based on application criticality
- Execute planned maintenance windows for cutover
- Validate application functionality after each cluster migration
- Decommission source VMware clusters after verification

### Risk Mitigation and Validation Strategy

**Enterprise Migration Risk Framework:**

| Risk Category | Risk Factor | Mitigation Strategy | Validation Method |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Application Compatibility** | 2,500+ VMs with varied workloads | Pilot testing with representative applications | Performance benchmarking and functionality testing |
| **Cluster Isolation** | No cross-cluster Live Migration capability | Careful application placement planning | Application dependency mapping validation |
| **Data Integrity** | Large-scale data migration across clusters | Azure Migrate built-in validation and checksums | Post-migration data integrity verification |
| **Operational Learning** | New management tools and procedures | Structured training program and documentation | Operational readiness assessment |

### Business Continuity During Migration

**Service Level Maintenance Strategy:**

**Application Categorization for Migration Priority:**

| Application Tier | Migration Priority | Downtime Tolerance | Migration Approach |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Business Critical** | Migrate last | Minimal downtime acceptable | Extended testing with planned maintenance windows |
| **Production Systems** | Medium priority | Planned maintenance windows | Standard Azure Migrate process |
| **Development/Test** | Migrate first | Extended downtime acceptable | Pilot migration for process refinement |
| **Legacy Systems** | Variable priority | Extended downtime acceptable | Manual assessment for modernization opportunities |

### Migration Timeline and Milestones (Enterprise-Scale)

**Realistic Timeline for 90+ Hosts, 2,500+ VMs:**

**Months 1-3: Foundation Phase**
- Azure Local cluster deployment and configuration
- Network connectivity between VMware and Azure Local environments
- Azure Migrate project setup and appliance deployment
- Team training on Azure Local management tools (Windows Admin Center, Azure Portal, PowerShell)

**Months 4-8: Application Migration Phase**  
- Pilot applications and development/test workloads (Azure Migrate process validation)
- Application performance validation and tuning
- Operational procedure refinement and documentation
- Backup and disaster recovery testing with new platform

**Months 9-15: Production Migration Phase**
- Business-critical application migration with extended testing periods
- Legacy system assessment for modernization opportunities
- VMware environment gradual decommissioning as clusters complete migration
- Post-migration optimization and team expertise development

**Learning Curve Expectations:**
- **VM Administration Team:** 3-4 months to achieve operational proficiency
- **PowerShell Automation:** 6-8 weeks intensive training for enterprise-scale management
- **Multi-Cluster Operations:** 4-6 weeks for Azure Portal and hybrid management expertise

### Post-Migration Validation Framework

**Success Criteria Validation:**

| Validation Area | Success Metric | Measurement Method | Timeline |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Application Performance** | Baseline performance maintained or improved | Performance benchmarking comparison | First 30 days post-migration |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Team productivity and incident response times | Operational metrics comparison | First 90 days |
| **Business Continuity** | Service availability and recovery time objectives | SLA compliance measurement | First 180 days |
| **Cost Optimization** | Infrastructure and operational cost analysis | Financial comparison with VMware environment | First year |

### Bottom Line

Azure Local migration requires understanding that cluster architecture limits are identical to VMware (16 hosts per cluster), but cross-cluster Live Migration is not available. Azure Migrate provides the primary migration path with agentless conversion for your 2,500+ VMs, demanding a realistic 12-15 month timeline with extensive validation and team training.

> **Key Takeaway:** Use Azure Migrate (preview) as the official Microsoft migration tool. Plan for identical cluster architecture (6+ clusters for 90 hosts) but prepare for cluster isolation - VMs cannot move between Azure Local clusters like they can with vCenter-managed VMware clusters.
