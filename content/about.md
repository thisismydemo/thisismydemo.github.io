# About

## Welcome to This Is My Demo

### Who Am I?

I'm a passionate IT professional with years of experience in Microsoft technologies, VMware, and hybrid cloud solutions. From my early days with SMS 2003 and VMware vSphere to mastering Azure Arc and Windows Server clustering, I’ve been immersed in Microsoft and VMware ecosystems for decades. My journey spans on-premises infrastructure, multicloud environments, and cutting-edge Azure Stack HCI deployments.

### What is This Is My Demo?

This blog is my platform for sharing knowledge, experiments, and insights on modern IT infrastructure. Expect deep dives into Azure Arc, Windows Server Failover Clustering, Storage Spaces Direct, and multicloud management, with a touch of automation using tools like Canonical MAAS and Azure CLI. From securing RDP over SSH to celebrating “12 Days of Azure Arc-Mas,” I aim to make complex tech approachable.

Originally built to explore Hugo, GitHub Pages, and Front Matter CMS, this site has grown into a hub for IT pros tackling hybrid and multicloud challenges. Powered by Markdown and a passion for learning, it’s my space to demystify enterprise tech—one post at a time.
