**Summary:** A no-nonsense TCO comparison across three platforms: VMware (post-Broadcom licensing), Azure Local, and Hyper-V with Windows Server Datacenter. Breaks down licensing models, hidden costs, and long-term projections. Addresses VMware's shift to subscription-only licensing with 72-core minimums and significant price increases. Compares Azure Local's per-core/month subscription model against Windows Server's perpetual licensing option. Shows when each platform makes financial sense.

**Scope Guidance:** Broadcom licensing has been a moving targetâ€”verify current models at publication time. Include often-missed costs: training investment, tooling ecosystem changes, operational familiarity loss, and migration effort. The spreadsheet template is high-value; make it genuinely useful.

**Key Deliverables:** Cost comparison framework, TCO calculator spreadsheet template, licensing model summary table
