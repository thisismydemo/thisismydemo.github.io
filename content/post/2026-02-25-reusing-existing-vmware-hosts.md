## Summary

Practical guidance on repurposing existing VMware hardware for Hyper-V deployments. Covers hardware compatibility validation, Windows Server Catalog considerations, driver availability, and firmware updates. Addresses common concerns about NIC compatibility (especially for RDMA), storage controller support, and BIOS/UEFI settings. Demonstrates that quality server hardware is hypervisor-agnostic—your Dell, HPE, or Lenovo servers work with any virtualization platform.

**Key Deliverables:** Hardware compatibility checklist, pre-migration validation script, vendor resource links, driver compatibility matrix template

**Repository:** All scripts, calculators, and resources available at [github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance](https://github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance)
