## Summary

Practical guide to integrating external storage arrays with Hyper-V clusters. Covers universal principles (iSCSI vs. Fibre Channel vs. SMB3 decision framework, MPIO configuration, LUN presentation best practices) with Pure Storage as a detailed implementation example. Demonstrates why three-tier architecture remains relevant for specific workloads. This is the "getting connected" post—advanced architecture patterns come later.

**Key Deliverables:** Storage protocol decision matrix, MPIO configuration guide, Pure Storage + Hyper-V reference configuration, vendor resource links

**Repository:** All scripts, calculators, and resources available at [github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance](https://github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance)
