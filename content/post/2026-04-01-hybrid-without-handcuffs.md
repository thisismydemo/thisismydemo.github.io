## Summary

How to integrate with Azure services selectively without committing to Azure Local's full model. Covers Azure Backup for Hyper-V, Azure Site Recovery for DR, Azure Arc for inventory and monitoring (optional), and Azure Update Management. Demonstrates that hybrid doesn't mean all-or-nothing—you can adopt cloud services incrementally while maintaining on-premises control and avoiding subscription lock-in.

**Key Deliverables:** Hybrid integration patterns, selective Azure adoption guide, cost/benefit analysis template

**Repository:** All scripts, calculators, and resources available at [github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance](https://github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance)
