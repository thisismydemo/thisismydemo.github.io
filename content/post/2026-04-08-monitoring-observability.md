## Summary

Comprehensive monitoring and observability strategy with a tiered approach. Tier 1: Native Windows tools (Windows Admin Center dashboards, Performance Monitor, Event Log analysis, PowerShell-based monitoring). Tier 2: Azure integration (Azure Monitor for on-premises, Log Analytics). Tier 3: Open-source stack (Prometheus + Grafana for those who prefer it). Demonstrates how to build effective alerting and capacity planning at any budget level.

**Key Deliverables:** Monitoring architecture decision tree, WAC dashboard templates, PowerShell monitoring scripts, Prometheus exporter configuration examples

**Repository:** All scripts, calculators, and resources available at [github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance](https://github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance)
