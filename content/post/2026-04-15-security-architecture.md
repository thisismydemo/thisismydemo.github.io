## Summary

Comprehensive security guide covering both cluster-level hardening and VM-level isolation. Cluster security: SMB encryption, cluster communication encryption, Credential Guard, Windows Defender integration, secure administrative practices. VM security: Virtualization-Based Security (VBS), Secure Boot, TPM integration, and an introduction to Shielded VMs with Host Guardian Service (with honest assessment of prerequisites and complexity). Addresses compliance requirements and audit considerations.

**Key Deliverables:** Security baseline configuration script, hardening checklist (tiered by complexity), compliance mapping guide, HGS readiness assessment

**Repository:** All scripts, calculators, and resources available at [github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance](https://github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance)
