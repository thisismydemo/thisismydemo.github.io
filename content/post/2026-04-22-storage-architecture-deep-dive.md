## Summary

Advanced storage architecture patterns for enterprise Hyper-V deployments. Covers storage tiering strategies, Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV) architecture decisions, backup integration patterns, replication design, and performance optimization. Addresses protocol selection (iSCSI vs. FC vs. SMB3) for different workload profiles. Includes CSV internals: direct I/O vs. redirected I/O, CSV cache behavior, metadata operations, and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:** Storage reference architectures, design decision matrix, CSV troubleshooting decision tree, performance baseline methodology

**Repository:** All scripts, calculators, and resources available at [github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance](https://github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance)
