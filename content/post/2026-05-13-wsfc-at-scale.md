## Summary

Scaling Windows Server Failover Clustering for large deployments. Covers multi-site clusters, stretched clusters, cluster sets (for managing multiple clusters as a unit), and managing large VM populations. Addresses operational challenges at scale: Cluster-Aware Updating, monitoring hundreds or thousands of VMs, capacity planning, and organizational processes. Windows Server 2025 supports up to 64 nodes and 8,000 VMs per cluster.

**Key Deliverables:** Scale architecture patterns, operational runbooks for large deployments, capacity planning tools, multi-site design considerations

**Repository:** All scripts, calculators, and resources available at [github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance](https://github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance)
