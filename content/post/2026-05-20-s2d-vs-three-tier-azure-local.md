## Summary

Fair, technical comparison of infrastructure approaches: Storage Spaces Direct (HCI/hyperconverged), traditional three-tier with external storage, and Azure Local (formerly Azure Stack HCI). Covers performance characteristics, failure domains, cost structures, operational complexity, and appropriate use cases for each. Provides honest evaluation of Azure Local's strengths (unified Azure management, integrated AKS, AVD optimization) and limitations (mandatory Azure connectivity, subscription costs). Helps readers make informed platform decisions.

**Key Deliverables:** Infrastructure decision matrix, workload fit assessment guide, Azure Local cost/benefit analysis, use case mapping

**Repository:** All scripts, calculators, and resources available at [github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance](https://github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance)
