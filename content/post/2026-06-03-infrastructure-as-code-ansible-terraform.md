## Summary

Infrastructure-as-Code for Hyper-V using industry-standard tools. Covers Ansible modules for Windows/Hyper-V management (well-supported via WinRM), and Terraform community provider for Hyper-V (with honest assessment of maturity). Demonstrates patterns for declarative, repeatable infrastructure deployment. Shows how Hyper-V integrates with modern DevOps toolchains. Builds on PowerShell foundation from Post 17.

**Key Deliverables:** Ansible playbooks for common scenarios, Terraform module examples (with caveats), IaC pattern documentation, tooling decision guide

**Repository:** All scripts, calculators, and resources available at [github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance](https://github.com/thisismydemo/hyper-v-renaissance)
