<p>This blog started as a way to play with the idea of moving my old blogs from sources like WordPress, Blogger, etc to something I could control myself.  Also something that was free. :) So this blog was born out of the need to learn how to use Hugo, GitHub Pages, and a front end like Front Matter. I have a way to go because everything is all new to me.  Markdown language is also a learning curve.</p>
<h4 id="about-github-pages">About GitHub Pages</h4>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> allows you to host your websites and your projects directly from a <a href="https://github.com/">Github repository</a>.</p>
<h4 id="about-hugo">About Hugo</h4>
<p>Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and
configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website. With its
amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.</p>
<p>Learn more on <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">GitHub</a>. Complete documentation is available at
<a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/">Hugo Documentation</a>.</p>
<h4 id="about-front-matter">About Front Matter</h4>
<p><a href="https://frontmatter.codes/">Front Matter CMS</a> is a free and open-source platform, dedicated to making it one of the best CMSs for your static site generator. I found them while trying to use other front ends for Jykell before I decided to use Hugo.</p>
