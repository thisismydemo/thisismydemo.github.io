That&amp;rsquo;s legacy tech. It can&amp;rsquo;t compete with VMware. &amp;lsquo;Hyper-V is dead,&amp;rsquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this sentiment more times than I can count. In hallway conversations at conferences, in architecture review meetings, in vendor comparison spreadsheets filled with red X marks in the Hyper-V column. For years, this perception has been the default position—sometimes justified, often not.
In this third post of the Hyper-V Renaissance series, we&amp;rsquo;re going to dismantle this myth systematically.</description></item><item><title>The Real Cost of Virtualization</title><link>http://thisismydemo.cloud/post/real-cost-virtualization/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 00:09:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thisismydemo.cloud/post/real-cost-virtualization/</guid><description>The invoice arrived, and the meeting quickly followed.

This isn&amp;rsquo;t just about price hikes. It&amp;rsquo;s about a fundamental shift in how infrastructure is consumed.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to the Hyper-V Renaissance</title><link>http://thisismydemo.cloud/post/hyper-renaissance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:14:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thisismydemo.cloud/post/hyper-renaissance/</guid><description>Introduction A Perfect Storm Creates Opportunity If you&amp;rsquo;ve been watching the virtualization market over the past eighteen months, you&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed something extraordinary: a once-stable industry thrown into chaos by a single acquisition. When Broadcom completed its $69 billion purchase of VMware in November 2023, few anticipated how dramatically—and rapidly—the landscape would shift. What followed wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a pricing adjustment; it was a fundamental restructuring that has sent shockwaves through data centers worldwide.</description></item></channel></rss>
