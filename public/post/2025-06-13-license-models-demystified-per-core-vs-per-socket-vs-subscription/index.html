<p>In our virtualization journey <strong>after VMware</strong>, understanding licensing models is crucial. Different platforms (Windows Server Failover Clusters, Azure Local, and Azure VMware Solution) use varying licensing schemes – <em>per core</em>, <em>per socket</em>, or <em>per subscription</em>. These not only impact cost but also hide tricky expenses that IT decision-makers must catch. In this detailed guide, we’ll compare <strong>Windows Server 2025 failover clustering with Hyper-V</strong>, <strong>Azure Local</strong> (formerly Azure Stack HCI), and <strong>Azure VMware Solution (AVS)</strong> to demystify their licensing and uncover hidden costs. We’ll also include sample cost calculations and discuss purchasing channels (CSP, EA, pay-as-you-go) to help you make an informed choice with up-to-date information.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-licensing-models-per-core-per-socket-and-subscription">Understanding Licensing Models: Per Core, Per Socket, and Subscription</h2>
<p>Before diving into each platform, let’s clarify the licensing terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Per Core Licensing:</strong> Costs scale with the number of CPU cores in a server. Modern Microsoft servers use this model – you must license all physical cores, with minimums per CPU and per server. For example, Windows Server 2025 Datacenter requires at least 16 core licenses per server (even if a CPU has fewer cores). This model replaced the old per-processor (socket) model in Windows Server 2016 and later. It provides granular scaling but means higher core-count CPUs cost more in licenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Per Socket (Per Processor) Licensing:</strong> An older model where you pay per physical CPU regardless of core count. VMware vSphere historically used per-socket licenses (with a core limit that was briefly enforced and then dropped). Microsoft used this in pre-2016 Windows Servers. While simpler (one license per CPU), it became less common as core counts grew – vendors shifted to per-core to align cost with CPU power. It’s still useful to mention because some <strong>enterprise agreements or OEM deals might phrase licenses per 2-core pack or 16-core pack</strong>, harkening back to socket bundles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subscription Licensing (Service-based):</strong> Here you pay for software as an ongoing service (monthly or annually) rather than one-time. This can still be tied to hardware metrics (e.g. per core per month), but you <strong>don’t “own” a perpetual license</strong> – you subscribe. Cloud services like Azure charge this way, and newer hybrid offerings do as well. <strong>Azure Local</strong> uses a subscription model (monthly fee per core) instead of a huge upfront license. <strong>AVS</strong> is an Azure service billed per host-hour. Even Microsoft now offers <em>Windows Server subscription licenses</em> (e.g. via CSP or Azure Arc) as an alternative to buying perpetual licenses. Subscription models convert CapEx to OpEx and often bundle continuous updates and support, at the cost of potentially higher TCO over a long period if not optimized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s break down how each solution – <strong>Windows Server Failover Clustering, Azure Local, and AVS</strong> – implements these models, and compare real costs.</p>
<h2 id="windows-server-2025-failover-clustering-with-hyper-v-per-core-licensing">Windows Server 2025 Failover Clustering with Hyper-V (Per Core Licensing)</h2>
<p><strong>Windows Server 2025</strong> (Datacenter or Standard edition) uses a <strong>per-core licensing model</strong> with optional CALs (Client Access Licenses) for user/device access. For a Hyper-V failover cluster, this means you must license <em>all physical cores on each host server</em>. Key points include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Core License Requirements:</strong> You need to license every core in every processor, with a minimum of 8 cores per CPU and 16 cores per server. Licenses are sold in 2-core and 16-core packs. For example, a dual-processor server with 2×10-core CPUs has 20 cores, so you’d need at least 20 core licenses (which is typically one 16-pack + two 2-packs). If a server has fewer than 16 total cores, you still must license 16 cores minimum by rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Standard vs. Datacenter Edition:</strong> <em>Windows Server Datacenter</em> permits <strong>unlimited VMs</strong> on a licensed host (great for virtualization density). <em>Windows Server Standard</em> covers <strong>up to two virtual machines</strong> per 16-core license (or per server, if fully licensed). You can <em>“stack”</em> Standard licenses to run more VMs (e.g. two Standard licenses cover 4 VMs on one host), but beyond a certain point Datacenter is more economical. In fact, if you need more than ~6–8 VMs per host (especially in a cluster), Datacenter edition usually makes sense. <em>Essential</em> edition is a special case for very small businesses (single-socket servers) and won’t apply to cluster scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Licensing in a Cluster:</strong> In a failover cluster, <strong>each host must be licensed to run all VMs that could fail over to it</strong>. This is crucial – if you have (say) 10 Windows VMs that could all run on Host A during a failover, Host A’s licenses must allow those 10 VMs. With Datacenter, it’s covered (unlimited). With Standard, you’d need to assign enough Standard licenses to Host A to cover 10 VMs (which could be 5× Standard licenses for that host, since each covers 2 VMs) – often erasing any savings vs. Datacenter. Thus, clusters generally use Datacenter edition for simplicity and full VM mobility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Costs (Perpetual License vs Subscription):</strong> Windows Server licenses are typically a one-time purchase (CapEx) unless you opt for subscription via a cloud program. As a rough guide, <strong>Windows Server 2025 Datacenter 16-core</strong> is around <strong>$7,000</strong> list, and <strong>Standard 16-core</strong> about <strong>$1,200</strong>. (These can vary by agreement; enterprise discounts apply.) So a 2-host cluster, each with 16 cores, would cost around $14k (2×$7k) for Datacenter – but that covers unlimited VMs on both hosts. The same cluster with Standard might cost ~$2.4k (2×$1.2k) but only cover 2 VMs per host; if you need, say, 10 VMs total, you’d end up buying multiple Standard licenses per host, narrowing the gap quickly. <strong>Software Assurance (SA)</strong> is an add-on (~25% of license cost per year) that grants rights to new version upgrades and other benefits (like Azure Hybrid Benefit). Many enterprises purchase SA or use subscription licensing via CSP, which essentially spreads payments annually – but the underlying per-core metrics remain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Features and Hypervisor Cost:</strong> One big advantage here: <strong>Hyper-V (the hypervisor) is included in Windows Server at no extra cost</strong>. Failover Clustering is also an included feature – no separate license for the clustering capability. This is a contrast to VMware vSphere, where you’d buy licenses for the hypervisor plus maybe add-ons for features. With Windows Server, once you’ve licensed the OS on the host, you get Hyper-V, Failover Clustering, Storage Spaces Direct, etc., included (though some advanced features like S2D require Datacenter edition). Essentially, <strong>the Windows Server license is your virtualization license</strong> – you don’t pay for a separate virtualization product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CALs (Client Access Licenses):</strong> If your Windows VMs provide services to users (e.g. file servers, Active Directory, etc.), CALs might be required per user or device. However, many organizations cover this via Microsoft 365 or EA bundles (e.g. M365 E3/E5 include Windows Server CAL rights). Importantly, CAL costs are <strong>the same regardless of virtualization platform</strong> – they’re a Windows access cost, not tied to whether you run on Hyper-V, Azure, or AVS. So we’ll assume CALs are already handled in your enterprise agreements, and not differentiate them in our cost comparisons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Windows Server 2025 New Licensing Options:</strong> Microsoft introduced the option to license Windows <strong>per VM</strong> (instead of per physical core) for customers with Software Assurance or subscription licenses. In this model, you license just the virtual cores allocated to a VM (with an 8-core per VM minimum) rather than all host cores – useful if you run only a few VMs on a big host. This is enabled via Azure Arc or CSP subscriptions. For example, if you had a host with 32 cores but only run 2 small VMs, you might license 8 cores per VM (16 total) instead of all 32. This can save money in niche scenarios, but in a heavily virtualized cluster it’s typically better to stick to the traditional per-physical-core model with Datacenter edition. Still, it’s good to know this flexible option exists for hybrid setups.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sample Cost Scenario – Windows Server Cluster:</strong> Imagine a <strong>2-node Hyper-V cluster</strong> in 2025, each server dual-socket with 16 cores total (32 cores cluster total). You plan to run ~20 Windows Server VMs. Here’s the rough licensing cost:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Datacenter Edition approach:</strong> License each host with 16 cores of Datacenter. That’s 2 × 16-core packs = 32 cores licensed (you must actually license 32 per host in this case, since each has 16 cores; 16-core is minimum per host). This costs roughly <strong>$14,000 per host</strong>, so <strong>$28,000 upfront</strong> for the cluster (list price). All 20 VMs are covered (unlimited VM rights), and you get features like S2D if you use it. No ongoing fees to Microsoft for 3 years, except optional SA (which might be ~$7k/year for both if you want upgrades/support).</li>
<li><strong>Standard Edition approach (stacked licenses):</strong> Each host with 16 cores requires one Standard license for 2 VMs. To cover 10 VMs per host (worst-case failover), you need 5× Standard licenses per host. That’s 5 × $1,200 = <strong>$6,000 per host</strong>, or <strong>$12,000</strong> for the cluster. Cheaper upfront than Datacenter <em>if</em> you truly only run ~10 VMs per host. But if VM count grows or you miscalculate failover needs, you might end up buying more. Also, Standard doesn’t allow S2D (no software-defined storage), pushing you to use a SAN or other storage.</li>
<li>In clustering, <strong>Datacenter is usually the safe bet</strong> despite higher sticker price. The break-even is often around 6–8 VMs per host as noted: with clustering and future growth, most choose Datacenter for virtualization rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>bottom line for Windows Server</strong>: It’s a <strong>CapEx-heavy model</strong> (buy licenses upfront), but once purchased, you can run loads of VMs without incremental costs per VM. If you <em>already own</em> Windows Server Datacenter licenses (perhaps from an EA), you can build a new Hyper-V cluster with <strong>no new license costs</strong> – effectively “free” aside from hardware. This makes traditional Windows clusters very cost-effective for Windows-heavy workloads – you leverage existing investments and pay no monthly fees. The trade-off is you manage the infrastructure fully and must handle hardware, upgrades (unless you have SA), and potentially slower innovation cadence compared to cloud services.</p>
<h2 id="azure-local-azure-stack-hci--subscription-per-core-with-azure-integration">Azure Local (Azure Stack HCI) – Subscription per Core, with Azure Integration</h2>
<p><strong>Azure Local</strong> (formerly <em>Azure Stack HCI</em>) is Microsoft’s hyperconverged cluster solution delivered <em>as an Azure hybrid service</em>. It uses a <strong>subscription licensing model</strong> – you pay a <strong>monthly fee per physical core</strong> in your cluster nodes. This turns your on-prem infrastructure into an OPEX model, more like cloud. Key details on Azure Local licensing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Subscription Cost per Core:</strong> The standard rate is <strong>$10 USD per physical core, per month</strong> for Azure Local. This is charged through an Azure subscription. For instance, a server with 16 cores costs $160/month in Azure Local fees. Microsoft sometimes quotes region-specific prices (e.g. ~€9 in EU) but ~$10 is a good ballpark. <strong>This fee covers the host OS (the Azure Local operating system)</strong> and all its features (Hyper-V, Storage Spaces Direct, etc.), <strong>but does <em>not</em> include Windows guest VMs</strong>. Think of it as “subscription to the hypervisor platform”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Windows Server Subscription” Add-On:</strong> If you want to <strong>include Windows Server guest licenses</strong> via the Azure subscription (instead of using your own licenses), Azure Local offers an optional add-on. This costs about <strong>$23.30 per core per month</strong> and <strong>grants unlimited Windows Server guest OS rights</strong> on the cluster. In other words, you pay a higher per-core fee, and then any number of Windows VMs on that host are considered licensed through Azure (no need for separate Windows OS licenses). The $23.30 includes the base $10 fee <em>plus</em> the Windows OS rights. You would choose this if you <em>don’t</em> have existing Windows licenses and want a simple single bill for everything. By contrast, if you pay only the $10 core fee, you must bring your own licenses for any Windows VMs (just like a normal Hyper-V scenario).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB):</strong> Here’s a huge factor: If you already have <strong>Windows Server Datacenter licenses with active Software Assurance</strong>, you can use Azure Hybrid Benefit on Azure Local. <strong>AHB will <strong>waive the $10/core host fees</strong> <em>and</em> cover your Windows VMs</strong>. In practical terms, this means <strong>Azure Local can potentially cost $0 in software fees</strong> for customers who transfer their Windows licenses to cover it. Microsoft allows you to <em>exchange</em> each 16-core Datacenter license to cover 16 cores of Azure Local hosts, and in doing so you pay nothing for those cores in Azure Local. It essentially treats Azure Local as “Azure” – your Windows license lets you run the host and VMs without additional cost. <em>Example:</em> A company with 64 cores of Windows Server Datacenter (with SA) could assign those to a 4-node Azure Local cluster (16 cores each). They would then pay <strong>$0 per month</strong> for Azure Local (instead of $640), and all Windows VMs on it are covered. This makes Azure Local extremely attractive to customers with existing licenses (no “double spend”). <strong>However</strong>, you do need to keep SA active to maintain AHB, which typically means renewing your volume license agreement every few years. If SA lapses, you’d have to start paying the per-core fee again. Still, as long as you maintain SA, Azure Local’s host fee is waived – a significant incentive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OEM Licensing Option:</strong> Another way to license Azure Local is via an <strong>OEM license from your hardware vendor</strong>. Many server vendors (Dell, HPE, Lenovo, etc.) can sell Azure Local pre-installed with a one-time license fee (often as part of the hardware purchase). This OEM license is <strong>valid for the life of the hardware</strong>. It essentially lets you pay upfront (CapEx style) instead of monthly. This can be appealing if you want a fixed cost and no ongoing Azure meter – especially for longer hardware lifespans. But note: an OEM Azure Local license <strong>ties to that server hardware</strong> – if you retire the server, the license doesn’t transfer. Also, OEM licensing usually doesn’t cover Windows guest VMs, so you’d still use your own Windows licenses or AHB for the VMs. OEM licenses are obtained through the hardware vendor’s channels, not directly in Azure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware and Support Costs:</strong> Azure Local <strong>requires you to procure hardware</strong> (Azure Local validated nodes) as a separate cost. The subscription fee is purely for the software service; it <strong>does not include any hardware</strong>. So you still have the CapEx of buying servers (or an as-a-service lease from your vendor). Plan for that in TCO – Azure Local’s $10/core might sound low, but you need capable HCI hardware underneath. The good news: features like S2D (software-defined storage) are included in Azure Local without an extra license – it’s effectively the HCI stack built-in. Also, Azure Local clusters come with a <strong>continuous update cadence</strong> (new feature updates annually, quality updates frequently) which is part of the service – you don’t pay for “upgrades” like a new Windows Server version, since the subscription keeps you current. <strong>Support</strong> for Azure Local is provided as an Azure service, meaning you may need an Azure Support Plan for help (or rely on your hardware vendor for hardware-level support). Many enterprises using Azure Local will have an <strong>EA or Azure support contract</strong> in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Integration (and potential hidden costs):</strong> Azure Local is managed via Azure Arc, and you can (optionally) use many Azure services with it – e.g. Azure Monitor for monitoring, Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery for DR, etc.. These services <strong>are not included</strong> in the $10/core fee; they incur their own Azure usage charges if you enable them. For example, sending your Azure Local logs/metrics into Azure Monitor (Log Analytics) might add a few dollars per node per month (for data ingestion and retention). Similarly, using Azure Backup or ASR for VMs would have their own per-GB or per-instance costs. In <strong>AVS, some of these management costs are bundled</strong> (e.g., the AVS service includes vCenter/NSX and Azure’s control plane, and you can view metrics in Azure at no extra cost), but with Azure Local you have a bit more à la carte approach. It’s not that Azure Local <em>requires</em> these extras – you can manage it with Windows Admin Center or System Center for no additional fee. But many will leverage Azure services for a truly integrated experience, so it’s wise to account for a modest Azure bill for management/monitoring. The <strong>positive side</strong> is Azure Local’s deep integration provides hybrid benefits – e.g., if you enable Azure Security Center or update management, you get unified tools even if it adds some cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Purchasing Channels:</strong> To use Azure Local, you need an <strong>Azure subscription</strong> (tenant) to register the cluster. This could be a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, an Enterprise Agreement (EA) enrollment, or via a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partner. There is <strong>no separate “pay up front” option from Microsoft</strong> except the OEM route – normally, you’ll see a meter running in your Azure bill. In practice, most midsize and enterprise customers use <strong>EA or CSP</strong> for Azure Local. If you have an EA, Azure Local consumption can draw down your Azure pre-committed spend (if you have Azure Monetary Commitment funds). CSP partners can also bundle Azure Local in a monthly bill to you. <strong>Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)</strong> direct subscriptions <em>are</em> technically supported – you could sign up with a credit card and connect an Azure Local cluster – but it’s less common for production since most organizations want consolidated billing and maybe negotiated rates. One thing to note: <strong>the $10/core and $23/core rates are standard</strong> across channels, but enterprise deals might provide some discounts or incentives. Also, <strong>Reserved Capacity</strong> isn’t really applicable to Azure Local (no 1-year or 3-year reservation like VMs) – the pricing is flat unless you have an EA discount. The <strong>OEM license</strong> option is outside of Azure billing entirely, which might appeal to those who prefer CapEx budgeting or avoiding Azure consumption accounting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sample Cost Scenario – Azure Local:</strong> Let’s reuse the scenario: 2 nodes, 16 cores each (32 cores total), ~20 Windows VMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you <strong>have no existing licenses</strong> and use Azure Local fully managed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay <strong>$23.3/core/month</strong> for all cores to cover hosts + Windows guests. That’s 32 cores × $23.3 = <strong>$745.6 per month</strong>, or about <strong>$8,950 per year</strong> for the cluster. Over 3 years, that’s ~$26,850.</li>
<li>Hardware cost is separate (say you spend $40k on two HCI nodes – just a placeholder). We’ll compare software costs here primarily.</li>
<li>This gives you a cloud-like model: always updated HCI OS, Azure integration, and all Windows VM licenses included in that monthly price.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you <strong>bring your own Windows licenses</strong> (Datacenter w/ SA) and use AHB:</p>
<ul>
<li>You pay <strong>$10/core/month</strong> for Azure Local, but AHB waives even that! In fact, with AHB <em>both</em> the $10 and the Windows guest fee are $0. You effectively use your existing licenses instead of paying monthly. So <strong>$0/month</strong> to Microsoft for software. (In reality, you already paid for those Windows licenses – e.g. the same $28k we calculated above – and you maintain SA which might be, say, $5-6k/year). But no additional cost from Azure beyond maybe some minimal Arc service charges.</li>
<li>This scenario is essentially identical to running a Windows Hyper-V cluster in terms of license cost, except you’re running the Azure Local OS and getting its extra features. Your prior investment in licenses carries forward.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you <strong>don’t have Datacenter licenses but want a lower monthly cost</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You could purchase Windows Server Datacenter licenses for ~ $28k (32 cores) and apply AHB. Then Azure Local host is free, and you use those licenses for VMs. Net 3-year software cost ~$28k (plus SA if you add it).</li>
<li>Alternatively, pay the monthly $745.6, which over 3 years is ~$26.8k – actually <em>slightly less</em> than buying the licenses outright in this calculation. However, after 3 years, if you extend to year 4/5 without major changes, owning licenses might become cheaper, whereas subscription keeps going. It’s a classic <strong>CapEx vs OpEx trade-off</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> At moderate scale, Azure Local’s subscription is in the same order of magnitude as traditional licensing. In our example, ~$9k/yr vs the one-time $28k – over 3 years, pretty comparable. The <strong>deciding factors</strong> are more about <em>flexibility and features</em>: Azure Local gives cloud-style management, rolling new features, one included support channel, etc., whereas the Windows Server approach is more static but you own it. The kicker is if you <em>already</em> have licenses, Azure Local can be dirt cheap, making it incredibly cost-effective for those leveraging AHB. On the other hand, if you <strong>run a lot of Windows VMs</strong>, be mindful: without AHB, you’d either pay for each Windows VM’s license or spring for the $23/core add-on. That can make Azure Local more expensive than a fully-owned Datacenter license if VM density is high. For instance, a host running “dozens” of Windows VMs is cheaper under one Datacenter license (one-time cost) than paying per VM or per core per month in Azure Local. So Azure Local’s sweet spot is often hybrid scenarios, folks with AHB, or those who value cloud integration enough to justify the ongoing fee.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="azure-vmware-solution-avs--dedicated-host-subscription-managed-service">Azure VMware Solution (AVS) – Dedicated Host Subscription (Managed Service)</h2>
<p><strong>Azure VMware Solution</strong> is a Microsoft Azure service that lets you run a <strong>VMware private cloud on Azure</strong>. In AVS, Microsoft provides physical hosts in an Azure datacenter pre-configured with VMware ESXi, vCenter, vSAN, NSX, etc., and manages the infrastructure while you manage your VMs. The licensing model is entirely <strong>subscription-based per host</strong> – you pay for each host (node) you allocate, billed by the hour or as reserved capacity. Key points for AVS licensing and cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Per-Host Pricing Model:</strong> You don’t purchase software licenses for vSphere/vCenter/NSX in AVS – those are included. Instead, you rent <strong>dedicated hosts</strong> in Azure. Each host has a fixed hardware configuration (e.g., an AV36 node = 36 cores, ~576 GB RAM, X TB storage) and a fixed hourly price. You are charged <strong>hourly per host</strong> while it’s deployed. For example, one <em>AV36</em> host might be on the order of ~$<strong>[price]</strong>/hour (exact numbers are region-specific and often shown as “$-/hour” on pricing pages until you log in). What we do know is that a minimum of <strong>3 hosts</strong> is required to create an AVS cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Typical Costs:</strong> While Microsoft doesn’t publish prices in docs without login, user reports give a sense: One estimate for an <strong>AV52 node</strong> in East US 2 was about <strong>$264k per year for 3 nodes with a 3-year reservation</strong>. That comes to ~$88k/year per host in that reserved scenario – which likely reflects a <strong>significant discount (perhaps ~50% off)</strong> for the 3-year commitment. Back-calculating, the pay-as-you-go rate for that AV52 might be on the order of $500k/year for 3 nodes (since 3-year reserved can save ~50%). In simpler terms, an AV36 host might cost roughly <strong>$5,000–$8,000 per month</strong> at 3-year reserved rates (depending on region), and more than double that on a pure pay-go hourly basis. These numbers are <strong>high-level</strong> – actual quotes are needed for precision. The main point: <strong>AVS is a premium offering</strong>, and its cost is measured in the thousands of dollars per host per month. It tends to be justified for larger environments or special cases, rather than small shops that only need a couple of servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VMware Licensing Included:</strong> The AVS price <strong>includes all VMware software licenses</strong> for the hypervisor and management: ESXi, vCenter Server, vSAN, NSX-T, HCX (Enterprise edition) are bundled. You do <strong>not</strong> need to bring any VMware licenses – you’re effectively paying for VMware as part of the service. This is why the cost per host in AVS is much higher than just a raw VM in Azure; it covers the enterprise VMware stack and the dedicated hardware under Azure’s management. Microsoft even covers things like <strong>VMware support</strong> and updates as part of AVS – it’s a fully managed service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Windows/Linux VM Licensing in AVS:</strong> <strong>Important:</strong> The cost of AVS <strong>does <em>not</em> include Windows Server or SQL Server licenses for the VMs you run on VMware</strong>. From Microsoft’s perspective, those VMs are like on-prem VMs, so you must license them separately. However, since AVS is hosted in Azure, you can use <strong>Azure Hybrid Benefit</strong> for your Windows and SQL VMs on AVS. In fact, Microsoft explicitly allows AVS users to apply AHB – meaning if you have Windows Server licenses with SA, you can assign them to cover your AVS VMs just as you would for Azure VMs. If you do that, you effectively pay nothing extra for those Windows OSes running in AVS. If you <strong>don’t have spare licenses</strong>, Microsoft recommends getting them (e.g. purchasing Windows Server licenses with SA) to use in AVS. There isn’t a built-in “pay-as-you-go Windows VM” meter in AVS like in standard Azure VMs – <strong>it’s BYO license model for guest OS</strong>. The expectation is enterprises moving VMware workloads will bring their existing Windows and SQL licenses or use this as a chance to renew through an EA. As noted in a Q&amp;A, if you have no licenses, you should consider purchasing Windows Server licenses (with SA) to cover all physical cores of the AVS hosts, which then gives you rights to all the VMs on those hosts. Essentially, treat an AVS host like an on-prem host from a licensing standpoint: license its cores with Windows Datacenter and you’re covered for unlimited Windows VMs on it. The difference is you can utilize AHB to avoid double-paying since it’s Azure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reserved Instances and Savings:</strong> <strong>Azure VMware Solution offers Reserved Instance pricing</strong> for 1-year, 3-year, and even 5-year terms, which dramatically lower costs versus pay-as-you-go. According to VMware, a 1-year reserved saves ~29%, 3-year ~50% compared to hourly rates. Microsoft even had a limited-time extra 20% off, pushing 3-year to ~60% off in some regions. <strong>Most customers use reserved capacity</strong> for AVS because the environments are persistent and the savings are huge. Also, many have <strong>Enterprise Agreements</strong> with Azure Consumption Commitments, and AVS spend counts towards those commitments (so you can burn your pre-paid Azure dollars on AVS). You can also <strong>burst</strong> capacity: e.g., run a minimal 3 nodes normally and add a 4th or 5th node temporarily for a project or DR test – you’ll be billed hourly for that node and you can drop it when done (note: you’re charged in full-month increments if a node is not kept the whole month). This elasticity is a benefit of AVS over on-prem (spinning up a host for 1 month on-prem is not possible, but in AVS it is, albeit with a minimum one-month charge).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimum Cluster Size and Scalability:</strong> <strong>3 nodes is the minimum</strong> to form an AVS cluster (for vSAN durability). This means the entry price is the cost of 3 hosts. For a small org that only needs, say, 2 physical servers worth of capacity, AVS might overshoot in cost by forcing a third. However, AVS can scale larger (up to 16 nodes per cluster currently, and multiple clusters if needed). There’s also a special 1-node AVS trial option for short-term testing or pilot (not for production), but production requires 3 nodes. So, consider that <strong>small environments have a high base cost in AVS</strong>. It shines more when you have larger scale or want to offload a sizable VMware footprint to cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hidden/Additional Costs in AVS:</strong> Most costs are bundled into that host price, but a few things to watch:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Networking:</strong> If you use <strong>ExpressRoute</strong> or a VPN for connectivity to AVS, those have their own Azure costs (ExpressRoute circuits, gateways, egress data charges). AVS itself doesn’t charge extra for NSX networking inside the service, but getting data in/out of AVS may incur standard Azure networking fees. If your AVS VMs communicate to other Azure services in the same region over the Azure backbone, that traffic is typically free or minimal; if they send data out to on-premises or internet, normal egress charges apply (though AVS gives you some free ExpressRoute bandwidth for management).</li>
<li><strong>Backup/DR:</strong> If you use Azure services to protect AVS VMs (e.g., Azure Backup can back up AVS VMs, Azure Site Recovery could potentially replicate them to another region), you’ll pay for those services per use. Many AVS users might also use existing VMware tools (vSphere Replication, SRM, etc.) which would run on AVS and possibly need additional licensing if not included.</li>
<li><strong>Guest OS support:</strong> Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for Windows Server 2012/2012R2 and SQL 2012 are <strong>free in AVS for 3 years</strong> (a nice perk – Microsoft waives those fees, whereas on-prem you’d have to pay for ESU if you needed it). This is a hidden <em>savings</em> rather than cost: if you have legacy servers, putting them in AVS spares you the 75% of license cost per year ESU charges.</li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> AVS is covered by Azure support plans. Typically, an enterprise already has a support agreement. There’s no separate VMware support contract needed – that’s bundled. But ensure you have an Azure support plan (or Premier/Unified support) that covers your needs for escalation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Purchasing and Channels:</strong> AVS can be activated in any Azure subscription with the appropriate quota (by default, many new subscriptions have zero quota for AVS until requested). Enterprises will use EA, CSP, or MCA (Microsoft Customer Agreement) subscriptions for AVS. <strong>Pay-as-you-go retail pricing is available</strong> (billed hourly), but as noted, almost everyone opts for reserved terms or some enterprise deal because of the cost. One cannot buy “AVS licenses” outside Azure – it’s exclusively an Azure service. Broadcom/VMware have introduced the ability to use <strong>VMware Cloud Universal credits or VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) subscription licenses</strong> portably in AVS, which could give a discount if you already bought a VMware subscription – but that’s a niche scenario where you pre-paid VMware and then apply those rights on AVS (a relatively new program as of late 2024). For most, the purchase is simply via Azure billing. It’s worth consulting an Azure specialist or partner to get a custom quote – at this scale, Microsoft often provides sizing and pricing help (and maybe incentive credits) for moving to AVS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sample Cost Scenario – AVS:</strong> Let’s compare with our scenario, though it’s not apples-to-apples (since AVS requires 3 hosts minimum):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Suppose we choose <strong>3 AV36 hosts</strong> to roughly cover the load of our 2 on-prem hosts (the AV36 has 36 cores, 576 GB RAM each, likely comparable or better than our 16-core on-prem servers). We go with a 3-year reserved instance for best economics. If one AV36 is, say, ~$6,000/month on 3-year (hypothetically), then 3 nodes = <strong>$18,000/month</strong>, which is <strong>$216,000/year</strong>. Over 3 years that’s ~$648k. (Remember, that includes all VMware licensing and the physical infrastructure in Azure’s datacenter, with 99.9% SLA uptime).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to license our ~20 Windows VMs. We can reuse the <strong>same Windows licenses</strong> we had – e.g., the 32-core Datacenter we bought for $28k – to cover those VMs in AVS via AHB. So no extra OS cost if we plan right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to $28k (Windows on-prem license) or ~$27k (Azure Local 3-year fees) in earlier scenarios, $648k is obviously a massive jump. But this illustrates AVS is a different beast – it’s providing a <strong>fully managed, enterprise-grade VMware environment</strong>. The cost difference often narrows when you consider larger environments: If we had, say, 10 hosts on-prem plus expensive VMware licensing and a DR site, AVS might come closer or even save money by replacing both production and DR with on-demand cloud hosts. AVS really targets scenarios where customers value eliminating data center footprint, aligning costs to cloud, and retaining VMware toolsets. For a small 2-3 host setup, AVS is usually not cost-justified purely on licensing – it’d be chosen for strategic reasons (e.g., temporary migration, cloud adjacency, or eliminating on-prem entirely).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That Reddit user’s figure: 3 nodes AV52 ~ $264k/year (with 3-year commit) – shows that a beefy config can cost about <strong>a quarter million per year</strong>. <strong>AVS is typically for companies that are comparing against the total cost of running a VMware estate</strong> – including hardware depreciation, support, VMware licensing, data center facilities, etc. In those terms, AVS can be competitive, especially if you factor that on-prem a VMware renewal or upgrade can be costly (“VMware Tax”) and you’d still have hardware costs. One comment noted that if you account for data center costs (power, cooling, space, staff), a reserved AVS can compare well, especially for DR use-cases or if you can spin down hosts when not needed. In essence, <strong>AVS shifts many hidden costs into one visible bill</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hidden-costs-and-considerations">Hidden Costs and Considerations</h2>
<p>Having outlined each model, let’s summarize <strong>hidden costs and key comparisons</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Upfront vs Ongoing Costs:</strong> Windows Server (on Hyper-V) is upfront-heavy (buy licenses, use for years), whereas Azure Local and AVS are ongoing subscriptions. Over a multi-year period, subscriptions might add up to more than a one-time purchase. However, subscriptions include continuous updates and often support. It’s important to <strong>calculate TCO over your intended lifespan</strong>. If you refresh hardware and software every 3-5 years, compare the 3-year costs directly. (Our examples: ~$28k for 3-year Windows vs ~$27k Azure Local vs $600k+ AVS for the same hypothetical workload – the range is wide, largely because AVS’s scope is larger and hardware included).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware and Facilities:</strong> In Windows Server and Azure Local scenarios, you need to purchase and maintain hardware (CapEx for servers, plus cooling, electricity, data center space, etc.). AVS includes the hardware and those facility costs in its price – you’re essentially outsourcing the data center. This is one reason AVS costs more, but also why an on-prem setup has “hidden” costs that aren’t on a Microsoft quote. If your data center is at capacity or you want to retire an on-prem site, AVS might save you significant facility expenses that partially offset the host cost. On the flip side, if you have a sunk-cost data center and skilled staff, keeping things on-prem (Windows or Azure Local) might be inherently cheaper if you don’t fully value the cloud’s managed aspect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Licensing Efficiency:</strong> Windows Server Datacenter shines when you pack many Windows VMs on a host – one cost covers all. Azure Local without AHB would make you pay per VM (via core add-on or stacking Standard licenses), which could be less efficient at scale. AVS similarly requires covering each host’s worth of Windows VMs with licenses (via AHB). If your environment is largely Linux, then Windows licensing is moot – you just consider the host costs. In Linux-heavy shops, Azure Local’s $10/core is basically the total cost (no Windows add-on needed) to run unlimited Linux VMs, which can be a very good deal compared to vSphere’s licensing. For AVS, if Linux, you also avoid any extra cost (just pay for hosts). So the equation changes with workload mix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature and Tooling Differences:</strong> Licensing aside, what are you <em>getting</em>? With Windows Server, you get a proven but traditional stack – long-term support lifecycle (~10 years per version), but fewer “new features” until major version upgrades. With Azure Local, you’re getting cloud cadence (feature updates yearly, requiring you to stay within 1-2 versions), tight Azure integration (Arc, Azure Portal management), and features like stretched clustering, AKS on HCI, etc., that even Windows Server 2025 might not have in-box. AVS gives you VMware’s rich feature set in a cloud model, plus the ability to integrate with Azure services (e.g., connect AVS to Azure native backups, or use Azure networking). These have value that’s hard to quantify in dollars but could tilt a decision. For instance, Azure Local can be run <strong>disconnected (air-gapped) with a special license</strong> in forthcoming versions, but normally requires periodic internet – if you absolutely have no internet, a traditional Windows cluster might be the only choice. Or if you have a huge investment in VMware-specific skill or tooling, AVS lets you retain that with minimal retraining, whereas moving to Hyper-V or Azure HCI might have retraining costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Purchasing &amp; Agreements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Windows Server</em> licenses can be bought via <strong>OEM (with a server), Volume Licensing/EA, or CSP</strong>. Enterprise Agreements often give better unit pricing and allow spreading payments (and include SA). CSP gives flexibility of a subscription (you can actually subscribe to Windows Datacenter licenses annually through CSP now). If you go CSP, you could even spin up Windows license as needed (though generally you’d keep it for the year).</li>
<li><em>Azure Local</em> requires an <strong>Azure account</strong>. Many mid-large orgs will incorporate it into an EA or buy via a partner (CSP). If you’re a smaller shop without an EA, you might use a CSP who can bundle Azure Local nodes and even the hardware (some MSPs offer Azure Local as a service). Note that <strong>Azure Local has a 60-day free trial</strong> for new deployments – a nice way to test before charges kick in. After that, charges are daily per core. Also, Azure Local (as of 2025) offers <strong>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) on HCI at no extra cost</strong> on newer releases – a freebie if you use containers.</li>
<li><em>AVS</em> is acquired by enabling the resource provider in Azure and requesting node quotas. Typically, you’d do an <strong>Azure Plan</strong> under CSP or an EA. <strong>Pay-as-you-go</strong> subscriptions can create AVS, but due to the high cost, Microsoft often requires spending limits or credit approval if you’re ramping up. AVS can consume Azure credits in an EA, which is good for those trying to meet commit. If you have a <strong>Microsoft MACC (Azure commitment) or AWS Enterprise Discount Program</strong>, note that you might get incentives – Microsoft was offering limited-time 20% extra off on reserved hosts to attract VMware migrations, and they often negotiate privately for big moves. Engaging your Microsoft rep is key with AVS to make sure you leverage any available benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comparative TCO Considerations:</strong> An honest comparison depends on your scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Small/Mid-size org with primarily Windows workloads, a few dozen VMs:</em> Windows Server Hyper-V with Datacenter licenses is likely the <strong>least expensive</strong> route. You pay once for licenses and can use existing hardware or buy new. Azure Local would introduce monthly fees that over e.g. 5 years might cost a bit more than just owning the license (unless you already have those licenses for AHB). AVS would be overkill cost-wise here.</li>
<li><em>Organization wanting cloud alignment, maybe with branch offices or edge needs:</em> Azure Local offers a nice middle ground – operational expenditure, Azure integration, but you still manage hardware. It can be cost-effective especially if leveraging AHB. It also allows using smaller 2-node clusters or even single-node (for edge) which VMware Cloud doesn’t offer (VMware’s smallest cloud units are still 3 nodes). So you can right-size better with Azure Local for smaller deployments.</li>
<li><em>Enterprise with a large VMware footprint considering evacuation of a data center:</em> AVS could be attractive despite seeming pricey. When you pencil out <strong>the “VMware Tax” (rising VMware licensing costs) plus hardware plus support plus data center overhead</strong> vs. AVS, the differences shrink. Microsoft touts that with AHB and reserved pricing, AVS can save up to <strong>85% on Windows/SQL licensing costs</strong> (through AHB) and ~50% on host costs (through 3-year RI) vs on-demand cloud rates. And you avoid big upfront refresh costs. So, for a company with, say, 100 VMware hosts up for hardware refresh and VMware license renewal, moving to 100 AVS hosts might actually be cost-competitive when you factor everything (and you’d gain ease of expansion, DR flexibility, etc.). It’s very case by case, but it’s why <strong>some enterprises are seriously evaluating AVS</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, <strong>there’s no one-size-fits-all answer</strong> – but knowing these licensing mechanics helps avoid surprises. <em>Per-core licensing</em> (Windows) gives you ownership and unlimited on-host usage once paid, but demands that upfront investment and careful capacity planning. <em>Subscription per-core</em> (Azure Local) offers cloud-like flexibility and evergreen software, with a modest ongoing fee – great if you already budget in Opex and especially if you can use existing licenses to nullify costs. <em>Subscription per-host</em> (AVS) offloads almost everything to Azure, at a premium price that is justified in scenarios where infrastructure overhead or speed of cloud scalability is paramount.</p>
<p>As you plan, be sure to <strong>engage your licensing resources</strong> – Microsoft LSPs (Licensing Solution Providers) or resellers can clarify specifics for Windows Server licensing options, and Azure specialists can provide tailored AVS quotes or Azure Local OEM offers. Also, keep an eye on new licensing programs: Microsoft is continually bridging gaps (for example, the new option to license Windows per-VM gives on-prem environments a pay-as-you-go flavor). Our goal here was to demystify the models so you can ask the right questions and do apples-to-apples comparisons.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Choosing the right virtualization path after VMware involves balancing technical capability with cost transparency. <strong>Windows Server 2025 Hyper-V clusters</strong> offer a tried-and-true, license-and-own model – often cheapest if you already have licenses and don’t need Azure integration. <strong>Azure Local</strong> brings cloud subscriptions on-premises, simplifying licensing (if you leverage AHB, potentially eliminating separate costs) and delivering new features regularly, but requiring comfort with an Azure-connected model and monthly billing. <strong>AVS</strong> provides a no-compromise VMware experience in the cloud, shifting all costs to Opex; it can be pricey, but for some it unlocks agility and removes the hidden costs of running a data center.</p>
<p>In all cases, <strong>understanding the licensing model prevents nasty surprises</strong>. We’ve seen how “unlimited” VM rights in one model might turn into per-VM fees in another if you’re not careful, and how a “low monthly price” can add up over time. By doing the math with your specific numbers – core counts, VM counts, existing licenses, and desired timeframe – you can pinpoint the Total Cost of Ownership for each option. Always account for those hidden costs (hardware, support, CALs, cloud add-ons) to make a fair comparison.</p>
<p>Finally, consider your organization’s strategy: If you value cloud innovation and hybrid capabilities, paying a bit more for Azure Local or AVS might be worth it. If cost minimization and full control are key, a Windows Server cluster might be ideal. Many organizations will find a mix – e.g., core workloads on Azure Local or Hyper-V, and certain use-cases on AVS or Azure for burst/DR. The good news is Microsoft’s ecosystem now has <strong>flexible licensing to support whichever mix you choose</strong>, without the punitive costs that prompted this re-evaluation in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Evaluate your inventory of licenses (do you have SA for AHB?), profile your workloads (Windows vs Linux, steady vs variable demand), and run a 3-5 year cost projection for each approach. This due diligence, though tedious, will pay off. By unmasking licensing complexities, you’ll be equipped to build a virtualization strategy that meets technical needs and stays within budget – with no lurking costs ready to upset your ROI.</p>
