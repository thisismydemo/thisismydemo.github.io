      <description>With most my blogs, they all start with me trying to do something I have done in the past and have forgotten or with something I have never had to do and now need to do it. So, is the case with this blog. I have never had to worry about establishing an ssh connection to a Linux VM in Azure via Azure Bastion until today.&#xA;I want to start this blog by showing how to connect via Bastion using the Azure Portal first.</description>
