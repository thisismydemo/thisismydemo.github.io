      <description>I guess this will be part II of another blog I wrote called What! My Azure Percept DK Devices Are Being Retired???. In that blog I mentioned how the Percept devices that were not cheap are now going into &amp;ldquo;retirement.&amp;rdquo; The only way to keep using them for other things is to install the last &amp;ldquo;Unsupported&amp;rdquo; firmware update before March 30th. This is my blog about how to install this update since you can no longer do OTA updates on existing devices at this time.</description>

      <description>Since I failed terribly at getting my old Azure Sphere Development kit up and running as documented in previous blogs I decided to move on to my Vision AI DevKit. This has been a trusty workhorse for me in the past assisting with many demos. However, just like my other devices, I haven&amp;rsquo;t used this in a while, now I need to reset it and set it up again.&#xA;The process The first thing I did was install the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).</description>

      <description>In a previous blog I wrote about having to recover my Azure Sphere Development Kit. So I decided to right one on what to do with it once I have recovered it. So this blog continues from My Azure Sphere Needs Reset?&#xA;However&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.&#xA;According to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s documentation on how to claim the device there is a call out:&#xA;Claiming a device is a one-time operation that you cannot undo even if the device is sold or transferred to another person or organization.</description>

      <description>So recently I started working on another IoT project which lead me to breaking out all my old development kits. I previously wrote a blog called My Azure Sphere Needs Reset where I walked through recovering an old Azure Sphere Development Kit I had. So I decided to write another few blogs following how I had to do the same with all my devices since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really remember any of the configurations and some of these devices had been configured for long gone IoT Hubs and tenants that don&amp;rsquo;t exist anymore.</description>

      <description>So I needed to break out my Azure SPhere Development kit again that I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched in a very long time. Since then, the tenant my Azure Sphere was registered to has changed, and along with other things like my memory in my aging head, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember for the life of me how to access the kit.&#xA;So this blog is mainly for me so in 6 months when I need to use my Azure Sphere development kit again I will have a quick and easy reminder.</description>
