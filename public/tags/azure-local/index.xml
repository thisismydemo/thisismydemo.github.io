      <title>Beyond the Cloud: Hardware Consider* **Path 1: Reuse Existing Hardware.** If your current servers and storage ran VMware vSphere reliably, you might prefer to repurpose them for the new solution. This path favors a platform that is **flexible with hardware compatibility**. Microsoft&#39;s traditional Windows Server &#43; Hyper-V is very accommodating here – it can run on a wide range of commodity servers and supports classic external SAN storage for clusters. In fact, Windows Server 2025 (with Hyper-V and Failover Clustering) offers much greater flexibility to **leverage existing gear** than Azure Local does. If your goal is to **maximize use of existing hardware**, the Windows Server route is often the best choice. It allows clustering with either shared storage (e.g., an iSCSI/FC SAN or NAS) or with internal disks via Storage Spaces Direct – giving you options to integrate with whatever infrastructure you already have.tions - Part III</title>

      <description>Hardware Considerations: Build Your Cloud on Your Terms Series Recap: In Part 1 of this series, we examined the total cost of ownership (TCO) implications of different post-VMware paths, comparing capital expenditure vs. subscription models across on-premises Hyper-V, Azure Local (formerly Azure Stack HCI), and Azure VMware Solution (AVS). In Part 2, we dove into licensing – analyzing how VMware vSphere licensing stacks up against Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s offerings (Windows Server and Azure Local) in 2025, and what those licensing differences mean for choosing a virtualization platform.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Part 2 of our &amp;ldquo;Beyond the Cloud: The Case for On-Premises Virtualization&amp;rdquo; series. In our introductory post, we explored why organizations are reconsidering their virtualization strategies post-VMware acquisition. In Part 1, we conducted a detailed five-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis comparing Windows Hyper-V, Azure VMware Solution (AVS), and Azure Local, revealing how different cost structures impact long-term budgets.&#xA;A key factor driving those cost differences was how each platform&amp;rsquo;s licensing model works.</description>

      <description>Introduction In our previous blog post, we explored why organizations are reconsidering their virtualization strategy post-VMware and highlighted the often-overlooked value of Windows Server Failover Clustering with Hyper-V. Now, in this first follow-up post of the &amp;quot;Beyond the Cloud: The Case for On-Premises Virtualization&amp;quot; series, we dive into the financial side of that decision. Specifically, we will compare the five-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for three possible platforms to run a 100-Virtual Machine (VM) workload:</description>

      <description>From My Perspective as a Microsoft Azure Hybrid MVP – Two Decades in Microsoft Hybrid &amp;amp; HCI I write this blog as a longtime Microsoft advocate with two decades of hands-on experience—from early Hyper-V in 2008 to today&amp;rsquo;s Azure Local. This series aims to highlight the potential of Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) as a viable alternative for organizations transitioning away from VMware, especially in light of Broadcom&amp;rsquo;s acquisition. While I value Azure&amp;rsquo;s Cloud and Hybrid offerings, I believe Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s current messaging overlooks WSFC&amp;rsquo;s capabilities in providing cost-effective, high-availability solutions.</description>
