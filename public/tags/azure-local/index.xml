      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of writing The Hyper-V Renaissance—an 18-part series making the case for traditional Hyper-V with Windows Server 2025 as a serious virtualization platform. It&amp;rsquo;s been consuming most of my writing time, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been heads-down on TCO comparisons, cluster builds, and PowerShell automation.&#xA;But sometimes you stumble across something that deserves its own post, and you have to step away from the main project for a minute.</description>

      <description>Introduction A Perfect Storm Creates Opportunity If you&amp;rsquo;ve been watching the virtualization market over the past eighteen months, you&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed something extraordinary: a once-stable industry thrown into chaos by a single acquisition. When Broadcom completed its $69 billion purchase of VMware in November 2023, few anticipated how dramatically—and rapidly—the landscape would shift. What followed wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a pricing adjustment; it was a fundamental restructuring that has sent shockwaves through data centers worldwide.</description>

      <description>From VMware vSphere to Azure Local: What Changes and Where to Click The industry shift away from VMware has accelerated dramatically. Organizations worldwide are evaluating alternatives, driven by licensing changes, acquisition uncertainty, and evolving business needs. For many enterprises, this transition represents both a significant operational challenge and a strategic opportunity to modernize their virtualization infrastructure.&#xA;This blog addresses the practical reality facing infrastructure teams: when organizational decisions mandate a platform change, success depends on understanding exactly how daily operations translate to the new environment.</description>

      <description>(Note: AVS – Azure VMware Solution – is not covered in detail here since it&amp;rsquo;s essentially outsourcing VMware onto Azure&amp;rsquo;s hardware. That involves a different calculus: you avoid buying hardware entirely, but you pay cloud rental fees and must fit into Azure&amp;rsquo;s instance constraints. In this post, we focus on on-premises alternatives where you control the hardware.)&#xA;Hardware Considerations: Build Your Cloud on Your Terms Series Recap: In Part 1 of this series, we examined the total cost of ownership (TCO) implications of different post-VMware paths, comparing capital expenditure vs.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Part 2 of our &amp;ldquo;Beyond the Cloud: The Case for On-Premises Virtualization&amp;rdquo; series. In our introductory post, we explored why organizations are reconsidering their virtualization strategies post-VMware acquisition. In Part 1, we conducted a detailed five-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis comparing Windows Hyper-V, Azure VMware Solution (AVS), and Azure Local, revealing how different cost structures impact long-term budgets.&#xA;A key factor driving those cost differences was how each platform&amp;rsquo;s licensing model works.</description>

      <description>Introduction In our previous blog post, we explored why organizations are reconsidering their virtualization strategy post-VMware and highlighted the often-overlooked value of Windows Server Failover Clustering with Hyper-V. Now, in this first follow-up post of the &amp;quot;Beyond the Cloud: The Case for On-Premises Virtualization&amp;quot; series, we dive into the financial side of that decision. Specifically, we will compare the five-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for three possible platforms to run a 100-Virtual Machine (VM) workload:</description>

      <description>From My Perspective as a Microsoft Azure Hybrid MVP – Two Decades in Microsoft Hybrid &amp;amp; HCI I write this blog as a longtime Microsoft advocate with two decades of hands-on experience—from early Hyper-V in 2008 to today&amp;rsquo;s Azure Local. This series aims to highlight the potential of Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) as a viable alternative for organizations transitioning away from VMware, especially in light of Broadcom&amp;rsquo;s acquisition. While I value Azure&amp;rsquo;s Cloud and Hybrid offerings, I believe Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s current messaging overlooks WSFC&amp;rsquo;s capabilities in providing cost-effective, high-availability solutions.</description>
