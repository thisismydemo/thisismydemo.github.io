Since then, the tenant my Azure Sphere was registered to has changed, and along with other things like my memory in my aging head, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember for the life of me how to access the kit.
So this blog is mainly for me so in 6 months when I need to use my Azure Sphere development kit again I will have a quick and easy reminder.</description></item></channel></rss>
