      <description>In a previous blog I wrote about having to recover my Azure Sphere Development Kit. So I decided to right one on what to do with it once I have recovered it. So this blog continues from My Azure Sphere Needs Reset?&#xA;However&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.&#xA;According to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s documentation on how to claim the device there is a call out:&#xA;Claiming a device is a one-time operation that you cannot undo even if the device is sold or transferred to another person or organization.</description>

      <description>So I needed to break out my Azure SPhere Development kit again that I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched in a very long time. Since then, the tenant my Azure Sphere was registered to has changed, and along with other things like my memory in my aging head, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember for the life of me how to access the kit.&#xA;So this blog is mainly for me so in 6 months when I need to use my Azure Sphere development kit again I will have a quick and easy reminder.</description>
