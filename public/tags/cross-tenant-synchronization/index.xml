      <description>So, I am very interested in What cross-tenant synchronization is and what it could do for me and maybe for customers? Since I have a number of tenants I thought it would be good to at least try this preview feature and blog about my experience.&#xA;Also, this blog originally started out as a single blog but as I started to write it it grew and grew and grew. I wanted to refocus myself and break it up into smaller parts.</description>
