      <description>There are times even your customers can teach you something. Recently while onboarding Microsoft Sentinel for a customer I ran into one of those times. I had been asked by the customer to integrate Microsoft Sentinel with Freshservice. Fresh service is one of many cloud based ITSM that I have run along my fun career. I personally don&amp;rsquo;t know much about Freshservice out side of the fact that my customer used it and had a use case where they wanted Sentinel to open a ticket in their system.</description>
