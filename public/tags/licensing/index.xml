For nearly two decades, the &amp;ldquo;cost of virtualization&amp;rdquo; was a line item we grumbled about but accepted. It was the &amp;ldquo;VMware Tax,&amp;rdquo; the price of admission for a stable, feature-rich datacenter. But in the wake of the Broadcom acquisition and the subsequent licensing overhaul, that tax has, for many organizations, turned into a ransom.

In Part 1, we conducted a detailed five-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis comparing Windows Hyper-V, Azure VMware Solution (AVS), and Azure Local, revealing how different cost structures impact long-term budgets.
A key factor driving those cost differences was how each platform&amp;rsquo;s licensing model works.</description></item></channel></rss>
