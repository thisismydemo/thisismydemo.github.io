      <description>There are times even your customers can teach you something. Recently while onboarding Microsoft Sentinel for a customer I ran into one of those times. I had been asked by the customer to integrate Microsoft Sentinel with Freshservice. Fresh service is one of many cloud based ITSM that I have run along my fun career.

      <description>So recently I have been dragged kicking and screaming into the security world. Well, not really dragged, if you know me I am a large guy and it would be more like fork lifting me kicking and screaming? Anyway, I actually love working with security products like Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Cloud and the many other Defender for.. Products Microsoft offers, along with Identify solutions like Entra Permissions Management and more.</description>
