      <description>I want to start this blog out by saying I am not an Intune expert. In fact I don&amp;rsquo;t really spend much time with Intune. However, once in a while there are projects that require certain tools like InTune so once in a while I do get my hands on Intune. So I want to share what I have learned about Intune Proactive Remediation and how to create and apply them in your Endpoint environment.</description>
