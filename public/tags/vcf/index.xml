That&amp;rsquo;s legacy tech. It can&amp;rsquo;t compete with VMware.&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this sentiment more times than I can count.

Not with marketing claims, but with verified specifications, feature-by-feature comparisons, and honest assessments of where Hyper-V excels and where it still trails.</description></item></channel></rss>
