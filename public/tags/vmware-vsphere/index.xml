      <description>I drink the Microsoft Kool-aid and have for many years. What you may not know is years ago, many years ago, I use to drink the Vmware Kool-aid and would attend VMUGs and was certified for VMware. This was about the version 4 days when vSphere was fairly new and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much more to Vmware than vCenter and ESXi servers. I jumped ship to the dark side, mainly because I started working with SMS 2003 and Configuration manager 2007 after a little bit of time working with Altiris Deployment Server and Notification Server.</description>
