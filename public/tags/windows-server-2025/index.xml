      <title>The Myth of &#39;Old Tech&#39;</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Hyper-V? That&amp;rsquo;s legacy tech. It can&amp;rsquo;t compete with VMware. &amp;lsquo;Hyper-V is dead,&amp;rsquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this sentiment more times than I can count. In hallway conversations at conferences, in architecture review meetings, in vendor comparison spreadsheets filled with red X marks in the Hyper-V column. For years, this perception has been the default position—sometimes justified, often not.&#xA;In this third post of the Hyper-V Renaissance series, we&amp;rsquo;re going to dismantle this myth systematically.</description>

      <title>The Real Cost of Virtualization</title>

      <description>The invoice arrived, and the meeting quickly followed.&#xA;For nearly two decades, the &amp;ldquo;cost of virtualization&amp;rdquo; was a line item we grumbled about but accepted. It was the &amp;ldquo;VMware Tax,&amp;rdquo; the price of admission for a stable, feature-rich datacenter. But in the wake of the Broadcom acquisition and the subsequent licensing overhaul, that tax has, for many organizations, turned into a ransom.&#xA;This isn&amp;rsquo;t just about price hikes. It&amp;rsquo;s about a fundamental shift in how infrastructure is consumed.</description>

      <description>Introduction A Perfect Storm Creates Opportunity If you&amp;rsquo;ve been watching the virtualization market over the past eighteen months, you&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed something extraordinary: a once-stable industry thrown into chaos by a single acquisition. When Broadcom completed its $69 billion purchase of VMware in November 2023, few anticipated how dramatically—and rapidly—the landscape would shift. What followed wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a pricing adjustment; it was a fundamental restructuring that has sent shockwaves through data centers worldwide.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Part 2 of our &amp;ldquo;Beyond the Cloud: The Case for On-Premises Virtualization&amp;rdquo; series. In our introductory post, we explored why organizations are reconsidering their virtualization strategies post-VMware acquisition. In Part 1, we conducted a detailed five-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis comparing Windows Hyper-V, Azure VMware Solution (AVS), and Azure Local, revealing how different cost structures impact long-term budgets.&#xA;A key factor driving those cost differences was how each platform&amp;rsquo;s licensing model works.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Cloud: Rethinking Virtualization Post-VMware</title>

      <description>From My Perspective as a Microsoft Azure Hybrid MVP – Two Decades in Microsoft Hybrid &amp;amp; HCI I write this blog as a longtime Microsoft advocate with two decades of hands-on experience—from early Hyper-V in 2008 to today&amp;rsquo;s Azure Local. This series aims to highlight the potential of Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) as a viable alternative for organizations transitioning away from VMware, especially in light of Broadcom&amp;rsquo;s acquisition. While I value Azure&amp;rsquo;s Cloud and Hybrid offerings, I believe Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s current messaging overlooks WSFC&amp;rsquo;s capabilities in providing cost-effective, high-availability solutions.</description>
