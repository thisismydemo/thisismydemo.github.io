## Reuse vs. Refresh: The Hardware Dilemma

When considering your post-VMware virtualization strategy, one of the first questions organizations face is whether to reuse existing hardware or invest in new equipment. This decision significantly impacts both initial costs and long-term operational success.

**The VMware Hardware Timeline Factor:** What makes this decision particularly urgent for many organizations is VMware's accelerating hardware obsolescence timeline. With VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 and ESXi 9.0, VMware is deprecating significant numbers of older server components (storage controllers, network adapters, etc.) that were supported in vSphere 7 and 8. Organizations staying with VMware face their own hardware refresh timeline pressure â€“ you can't simply renew VMware licenses and keep running on the same hardware indefinitely. VMware's compatibility guides now warn that upgrading to ESXi 9.0 with unsupported devices can result in **loss of storage or network access**, forcing hardware replacement before the upgrade. This creates a unique situation: **both staying with VMware and moving to Azure Local may require new hardware**, but for different reasons and on different timelines.

### Path 1: Reuse Existing Hardware

If your current servers and storage ran VMware vSphere reliably, you might prefer to repurpose them for the new solution. This path favors a platform that is flexible with hardware compatibility. Microsoft's traditional Windows Server + Hyper-V is very accommodating here â€“ it can run on a wide range of commodity servers and supports classic external SAN storage for clusters. 

In fact, Windows Server 2025 (with Hyper-V and Failover Clustering) offers much greater flexibility to leverage existing gear than Azure Local does. If your goal is to maximize use of existing hardware, the Windows Server route is often the best choice. It allows clustering with either shared storage (e.g., an iSCSI or FC SAN or NAS) or with internal disks via Storage Spaces Direct â€“ giving you options to integrate with whatever infrastructure you already have.

**The Hidden Advantage:** What many organizations don't realize is that choosing Windows Server Hyper-V doesn't just give you immediate VMware exit options â€“ it gives you **timeline control**. You can migrate away from VMware immediately using existing hardware, then gradually modernize your infrastructure over months or years rather than being forced into a forklift upgrade to meet someone else's deadline.

### Path 2: Refresh with New Hardware

Some organizations align their hardware refresh cycle with moving off VMware. Microsoft's Azure Local is positioned as a modern hyper-converged solution, but it almost always requires new hardware to meet its certified solution requirements. 

Azure Local runs on specific validated node configurations â€“ typically turnkey integrated systems from OEM partners (Dell, HPE, Lenovo, etc.) â€“ rather than just any random server. In fact, Microsoft notes that you can only repurpose existing servers for Azure Local if they exactly match a current validated node profile in the Azure Local Catalog.

> In approximately **99.9% of cases**, existing hardware will not meet the stringent requirements for Azure Local deployment. This statistic, while seemingly harsh, reflects the reality of modern hyperconverged infrastructure demands.

In practice, unless your older servers were originally purchased as a supported HCI solution, this is rarely the case. The Azure Local program emphasizes using approved hardware to ensure stability â€“ following the validated hardware path helps avoid "ghost chasing" of obscure firmware issues under load. OEMs provide jointly supported solutions, and Microsoft "highly recommends" integrated systems that come pre-built and pre-tested for Azure Local. 

**Current Azure Local Catalog State:** As of late 2024, the catalog includes:
- **100+ validated hardware configurations** from leading vendors
- **New low-specification options** for smaller deployments  
- **Expanded processor support** including Intel and AMD latest generations
- **Flexible storage configurations** accommodating various workload types

However, the catalog's expansion doesn't change the fundamental reality: existing enterprise hardware rarely meets the precise specifications required for certification. The result is a rock-solid platform, but at the cost of being locked into new hardware purchases in the near term.

### Making the Decision: Framework and Considerations

When evaluating your hardware refresh strategy, consider this decision flow:

1. **Audit Current Hardware** - CPU generation and features, memory type and capacity, storage configuration and performance, network capabilities

2. **Compare Against Requirements** - Check Azure Local hardware catalog, identify gaps and compatibility issues, calculate upgrade costs vs. replacement

3. **Evaluate Business Impact** - Deployment timeline requirements, performance expectations, support and maintenance needs, budget constraints

4. **Consider External Pressures** - VMware upgrade deadlines and deprecated hardware, budget approval timelines, vendor delivery schedules for new hardware

#### Hardware Investment Comparison

| Approach | Initial Cost | Long-term TCO | Risk Level | Timeline Control |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------------|------------------|
| **Reuse Existing (Windows Server)** | Low | Medium | Low-Medium | High |
| **Refresh with Certified (Azure Local)** | High | Low | Low | Low |
| **VMware VCF 9.0 Upgrade** | Medium | High | Medium | Low |

**Key Considerations:**
- **Reuse Existing**: Immediate VMware exit capability, gradual modernization on your timeline
- **Refresh with Certified**: Modern infrastructure but forced timeline and significant upfront investment
- **VMware Upgrade**: Hardware refresh required anyway, but ongoing licensing costs and vendor lock-in

In short, Windows Server Hyper-V (WSFC) offers a "build your cloud on your terms" approach â€“ you can likely reuse your existing mix of servers and storage â€“ whereas Azure Local usually mandates a clean slate with new, homogenized hardware. Next, we'll compare these options in detail: using Windows Server on your current infrastructure (either with your SAN or with Storage Spaces Direct) versus rolling out Azure Local on vendor-validated nodes.
