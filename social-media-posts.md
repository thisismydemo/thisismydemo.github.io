🛠️ **Odin for Azure Local: A Community Tool Deep Dive**

Curious about Azure Local deployments? I just published a deep dive into Odin—the open-source, community-built wizard for planning and designing Azure Local clusters. Odin guides you through every decision: deployment type, storage, networking, security, and more. It even generates design docs and ARM templates!

What makes Odin stand out:
• Sizer tool for right-sizing clusters
• Knowledge base with real-world Azure Local guidance
• Designer wizard for step-by-step configuration
• Open source, rapidly evolving, and community-driven

I break down what works, what’s missing, and what’s coming next. If you’re planning Azure Local or just want to see where Microsoft’s hybrid story is headed, this is a must-read.

🚀 **The Myth of 'Old Tech': Why Hyper-V 2025 Is Anything But Outdated**

“Hyper-V is legacy tech.” Not anymore. In my latest post, I break down the specs, features, and real-world capabilities of Windows Server 2025 Hyper-V vs. VMware Cloud Foundation. Spoiler: Hyper-V now matches or beats VMware in vCPU, RAM, cluster size, and more. Plus, it’s enterprise-ready, with live migration, advanced storage, and robust management tools. If you haven’t looked at Hyper-V lately, it’s time for a second opinion.

💡 **Is Hyper-V Really “Old Tech”?**

I keep hearing that Hyper-V is outdated, but the numbers say otherwise! Windows Server 2025 Hyper-V now matches or beats VMware in almost every way—vCPUs, RAM, cluster size, features, you name it. I dug into the specs and did a feature-by-feature comparison. If you think Hyper-V is just for small shops, you might be surprised!
