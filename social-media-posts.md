üìä **The True Cost of Virtualization: A 5-Year TCO Deep Dive**

I just published a comprehensive cost analysis comparing three virtualization approaches for running 100 VMs over 5 years. The results might surprise you!

**The Contenders:**
üñ•Ô∏è **On-Premises Hyper-V** (traditional CapEx)
‚òÅÔ∏è **Azure VMware Solution** (pure cloud OpEx)  
üîÑ **Azure Local** (hybrid model)

**Key Findings:**

üí° **On-Premises Hyper-V: $80-90K total**
- One-time investment in hardware ($45K) + Windows Server licenses ($36-40K)
- Minimal ongoing costs after year 1
- Best ROI for stable, long-term workloads

üí° **Azure Local: $80-240K (depends on licensing)**
- Same hardware costs as Hyper-V
- $240K with subscription model vs ~$90K with Azure Hybrid Benefit
- Gets you cloud integration + continuous updates

üí° **Azure VMware Solution: $600K**
- No upfront costs but steep monthly fees ($10K/month)
- Includes all infrastructure + VMware licensing
- 7x more expensive than on-premises options

**The Verdict:** For steady-state workloads, traditional CapEx investments pay off significantly. Cloud makes sense for variable/strategic workloads despite the premium.

This aligns with industry studies showing cloud can cost 3-5x more for constant workloads vs. owning your infrastructure.

What's your experience with virtualization costs? Are you seeing similar patterns in your environment?

**CapEx vs. OpEx: TCO Analysis for Virtualization Platforms**

I've conducted a 5-year Total Cost of Ownership analysis comparing three approaches for a 100-VM environment as organizations evaluate post-VMware strategies.

**Key Findings:**
Traditional CapEx (on-premises Hyper-V) delivers the lowest TCO at ~$80-90K over 5 years, while cloud solutions cost 3-7x more for steady-state workloads.

**üèÜ On-Premises Hyper-V: ~$80-90K**
- Hardware: $45K (3-node cluster)
- Software: $36-40K (Windows Server Datacenter)
- Ongoing costs: Minimal after initial investment

**ü•à Azure Local: $80-240K**
- Same $45K hardware investment
- $240K (subscription) OR ~$90K (with Azure Hybrid Benefit)
- Gets continuous updates, Azure integration

**ü•â Azure VMware Solution: ~$600K**
- No upfront costs, $10K/month recurring
- Includes all infrastructure + VMware licensing
- 7x more expensive than on-premises

**Strategic Insights:**
üìà Hyper-V's cost curve flattens after year 1, while cloud costs accumulate linearly
üîÑ Azure Local offers flexibility between CapEx (AHB) and OpEx models
‚öñÔ∏è Cloud solutions provide agility advantages that may justify premium costs

**Key Takeaways:**
- CapEx investments deliver superior ROI for stable workloads
- Leverage existing Windows licensing via Azure Hybrid Benefit
- Cloud excels for variable/strategic workloads despite higher costs
- Microsoft offers full spectrum from pure CapEx to pure OpEx

The data supports "invest upfront in ownership" for cost-conscious organizations running steady workloads.

What factors weigh most heavily in your virtualization strategy decisions?
