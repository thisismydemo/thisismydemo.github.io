## VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0: Current Hardware Requirements

Before we conclude, a brief aside for those weighing staying with VMware versus switching: VMware's platform (vSphere 9.0, packaged in **VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0**) **became Generally Available on June 17, 2025** and brings immediate hardware considerations that might influence your strategy. 

### Updated Hardware Requirements and Deprecation Reality

VMware is raising the bar on supported hardware in vSphere 9. For example, a number of older server I/O devices (storage controllers, network adapters, etc.) are being deprecated in **ESXi 9.0**. VMware's compatibility guides indicate some devices that were supported in vSphere 7 or 8 will not be supported going forward unless vendors provide updated drivers.

**New ESXi 9.0 Minimum Requirements:**
- **Boot Storage**: 128 GB persistent storage (up from 8 GB)
- **BIOS**: UEFI required (legacy BIOS deprecated)
- **Memory**: 8 GB minimum (12 GB recommended for production)

### Two Categories of Device Support

VMware has implemented a two-tier approach to hardware deprecation:

**Restricted Devices**: Driver present but marked "Restricted" in compatibility guides - limited support, no new features
**End-of-Life Devices**: Driver completely removed - devices won't be recognized by ESXi 9.0

### Critical Upgrade Risks

In fact, VMware has warned that if you attempt to upgrade to ESXi 9.0 on a host that contains an **end-of-life (unsupported) device**, the upgrade may fail or, even if it succeeds, you could **lose access to storage or networking on that host**. According to **VMware KB 391170**, upgrading with EOL devices can cause:

> **⚠️ Non-Recoverable Consequences**
>
> - Complete loss of storage access to datastores
> - Network connectivity failure on affected NICs
> - Host configuration corruption requiring rebuild

In other words, running vSphere 9 will likely require weeding out any legacy HBAs or NICs that aren't on the approved list. VMware's guidance is clear: **replace deprecated hardware before upgrading**. 

### Cost Impact of VMware Hardware Refresh

This means that even if you wanted to stick with VMware on the same physical servers, you might have to invest in hardware upgrades (new NICs, RAID cards, etc.) to stay on a supported configuration.

**Typical VMware Hardware Refresh Costs** (4-host cluster):
- Deprecated NICs replacement: $8,000-15,000
- Storage controller upgrades: $12,000-25,000
- UEFI-compatible servers: $80,000-200,000+
- **Total**: $100,000-240,000+ before VCF 9.0 licensing

### Decision Timeline Pressure

**Critical Reality**: With VCF 9.0 now GA, organizations face immediate decisions:
- Upgrade VMware infrastructure with required hardware refresh
- Stay on older VMware versions with limited support lifecycle
- Migrate to alternative platforms

**Recommended Action Timeline**:
- **30 days**: Audit hardware against KB 391170 deprecated device lists
- **60 days**: Get vendor compatibility assessments
- **90 days**: Execute hardware upgrade or migration decision

### VMware vs. Alternative Platforms

| **Factor** | **VMware VCF 9.0** | **Windows Server** | **Azure Local** |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Hardware Compatibility** | Strict (EOL devices must go) | Flexible (broad compatibility) | Strict (validated nodes only) |
| **Timeline Pressure** | Immediate (GA forces decision) | Flexible (plan migration) | Flexible (plan migration) |
| **Hardware Investment** | High (refresh required) | Low (reuse existing) | High (new nodes required) |

So either path – moving to Microsoft or staying with VMware's latest – points to hardware updates sooner or later. The advantage of the Microsoft path with Windows Server is that you could potentially run on your existing hardware *for a while longer* (since Windows is generally tolerant as long as drivers exist), buying you time until a planned hardware refresh. 

**Updated Reality**: With VCF 9.0 now GA, staying with VMware no longer provides the luxury of gradual hardware transitions – the decisions are immediate and mandatory.

In contrast, pushing into VMware's newest stack might force an immediate hardware refresh anyway. It's an important factor to weigh: leaving VMware could actually extend the useful life of your current servers if you go with a more flexible platform.
